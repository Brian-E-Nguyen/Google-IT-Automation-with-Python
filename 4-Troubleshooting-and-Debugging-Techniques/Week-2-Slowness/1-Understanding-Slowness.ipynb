    "# Understanding Slowness \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Intro to Module 2: Slowness\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back, and congrats on making it through that tricky lab that wrapped up the first module. Feels good to have solved an actual problem and get the computer working again, right? Personally, one of the things I love about my job is being able to take control of the system and make it do what I want it to do. Remember that if things don't work right away, it's totally fine. The more you try your hand at solving problems, the easier you'll come up with possible solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A problem that we have to deal with a lot when working in IT, is things being slow. This could be our computer, our scripts, or even complex systems. Slow is a relative term. Modern computers are much faster and can do many more things than computers a couple of decades ago. Still, we always want them to be faster and to do more in less time. \n",
    "\n",
    "With modern day computers it might seem that our resources are unlimited, but if we try hard enough we can hit the limits. For example, if you're browsing the internet and you open a new tab in your browser, it might seem like it doesn't take any resources at all. It's just a click and you have a new tab available. But if you keep opening tabs, at some point your computer will become sluggish. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the hardware of the computer and what other programs are running, it might take 100 or more open tabs to get there. But eventually, you'll run out of memory and everything will slow down. There's a bunch of different things we can do if our system is too slow. The most obvious one is closing any applications we don't need at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This works because it helps us free some of the resources in our computer, like CPU time, RAM, or video memory. That way the program that we want to run faster will have access to more of these resources. When closing applications that we don't need we might even need to look at applets, plugins, extensions, or other small programs that might seem harmless, as they take some resources to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, closing any other elements that take resources, like browser tabs or open files in a document editor, can also help. But this only gets us so far because there's a ton of other reasons why our devices or programs might be slow. Over the course of the next few videos we'll do a rundown of the different reasons that can make things run slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look into what causes slow scripts, slow computers, or slow systems. We'll give you the tools to help you identify the most common causes of slowness, and apply solutions to improve the overall performance. We've got a lot to cover, but don't worry will guide you through everything and we'll take it slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why is my computer slow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computers execute thousands of millions of instructions per second. Each of those instructions does one small thing, like incrementing a value, comparing two values, or moving a value from one place to another. Still with thousands of millions of instructions per second, there's a lot that a computer can do in just one second. This allows our computer to seemingly execute a number of different thing at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're browsing the web while also running an application that plays your favorite music in the background. Even if your computer has a single core to execute those applications, it will seem like the computer is running these two programs at the same time. What's happening under the hood is that each application gets a fraction of the CPU time, and then the next application gets a turn. Most of the time this works fine. But if you run too many applications or if one of these applications were running needs more CPU time than the fraction it's getting, things might become frustratingly slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general strategy for addressing slowness is to i**dentify the bottleneck** for addressing slowness in our device, our script, or our system to run slowly. The bottleneck could be the CPU time as we just mentioned. But it could also be time spent reading data from disk waiting for data transmitted over the network, moving data from disk to RAM, or some other resource that's limiting the overall performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty often, we can speed things up and getting rid of anything else that's using resources on the same computer. So if the problem is that your program needs more CPU time, you can close other running programs that you don't need right then. If the problem is that you don't have enough space on disk, you can uninstall applications that you don't use, or delete or move data that doesn't need to be on that disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem is that the application needs more network bandwidth, you can try stopping any other processes that are also using the network and so on. This only helps us if the issue is that there are too many processes trying to use the same resource. If we've closed everything that wasn't needed and the computer is still slow, we need to look into other possible explanations. What if the hardware we're using just isn't good enough for the applications we're trying to run on it? In cases like these, will have to upgrade the underlying hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "But to make a difference in the resulting performance, we need to make sure that we're actually improving the bottleneck and not just wasting our money on new hardware that will go unused. So how can we tell which piece of hardware needs to be changed? We need to monitor the usage of our resources to know which of them as being **exhausted.** *This means that it's being used completely and programs are getting blocked by not having access to more of it.* Is it the CPU, the memory, the disk IO, the network connection, the graphics card? To find out, we use the tools available in our operating system, monitor the usage of each resource, and then work out which one is blocking our programs for running faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already talked about using `top` on Linux systems. This tool lets us see which currently running processes are using the most CPU time. \n",

    "If we start by memory, which ones are using the most memory.

We also called out in earlier videos a couple of other programs like `iotop` and `iftop`. They can help us see which processes are currently using the most disk IO usage or the most network bandwidth. \n",
    "\n",
    "On MacOS, the OS ships with a tool called Activity Monitor which lets us see what's using the most CPU, memory, energy, disk, or network. On Windows, there's a couple of OS tools called **Resource Monitor** and **Performance Monitor** which also let us analyze what's going on with the different resources on the computer including CPU, memory, disk and network. So if you're looking to diagnose what's causing your computer to run slow, the first step is always to open one of these tools. Check out what's going on, and try to understand which resources the bottleneck and why. Then plan how you're going to solve the issue. \n",

    "Of course, not all performance problems are solved by closing applications are getting better hardware. Sometimes, we need to figure out what the software is doing wrong and where it's spending most of its time to understand how to make it run faster. We need to really study each problem to get to the root cause of the slowness. Up next, we'll talk about some ideas to help us better understand what's going on under the hood."

    "## 3. How Computers Use Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last video, we called out how a computer can be constrained by different resources like CPU, disk, memory, or network. We discussed how we need to eliminate the bottlenecks and get our computer to better use its resources to boost our system's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we need to understand how each component interacts with the other and what the limitations are. In particular, when thinking about making things faster, it's important to understand the different speeds of the parts involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 How Data is Accessed\n",
    "\n",
    "When an application is accessing some data, the time spent retrieving that data will depend on where it's located. If it's a variable that's currently being used in a function, the data will be in the CPU's internal memory, and our program will retrieve it really fast. If the data is related to a running program but maybe not the currently executing function, it will likely be in RAM, and our program will still get to a pretty fast. If the data is in a file, our program will need to read it from disk, which is much slower than reading it from RAM, and worse than reading from disk, is reading information from over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Ways to Access Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have a lower transmission speed, and we also need to establish the connection to the other endpoint to make the transmission possible, which adds to the total time needed to get to the data. So if you have a process that requires repeatedly reading data over the network, you might want to figure out if you can read it once stored on disk, and then read it from disk afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or similarly, if you repeatedly reading files from disk, you might see if you can put the same information directly into the process memory and avoid loading it from disk every time. In other words, you want to consider if you can create a cache. A **cache** *stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.* There's a ton of examples of caches in IT. A web proxy is a form of cash. It stores websites, images, or videos that are accessed often by users behind the proxy. So they don't need to be downloaded from the Internet every time. \n",
    "\n",
    "DNS services usually implement a local cache for the websites they resolve. So they don't need to query from the Internet every time someone asks for their IP address. The operating system also takes care of some caching for us. It tries to keep as much information as possible in RAM so that we can access it fast. This includes the contents of files or libraries that are accessed often, even if they aren't in use right now. We say that these contents are **cached in memory.** We call that that if the data is part of a program that's currently running, it will be in RAM. But RAM is limited. If you run enough programs at the same time, you'll fill it up and run out of space. What happens when you run out of RAM? At first, the OS will just remove from RAM anything that's cached, but not strictly necessary. If there's still not enough RAM after that, the operating system will put the parts of the memory that aren't currently in use onto the hard drive in a space called swap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and writing from disk is much slower than reading and writing from RAM. So when the swapped out memory is requested by an application, it will take a while to load it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "The swapping implementation varies across the different operating systems, but the concept is always the same. The information that's not needed right now is removed from RAM and put onto the disk, while the information that's needed now is put into RAM. This is normal operation, and most of the time, we don't notice it. But if the available memory is significantly less than what the running applications need, the OS will have to keep swapping out the data that's not in use right now to move the data currently in use to RAM, and as we called out, our computer can switch between applications very quickly, which means that the data currently in use can also change very quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computer will start spending a lot of time writing to disc to make some space in RAM and then reading from disk to put other things in RAM. This can be super slow. So what do you do if you find that your machine is slow because it's spending a lot of time swapping? There are basically three possible reasons for this. We've already talked about two of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, if there are too many open applications and some can be closed, close the ones that aren't needed. \n",
    "2. Or if the available memory is just too small for the amount that computer is using, add more RAM to the computer. \n",
    "3. The third reason is that one of the running programs may have a memory leak, causing it to take all the available memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A memory leak** *means that memory which is no longer needed is not getting released.* We'll talk a bunch more about memory leaks later in the course. For now, let's just say that if a program is using a lot of memory and this stops when you restart the program, it's probably because of a memory leak. Up next, we'll discuss a bunch more different reasons our computer might run slowly and what we can do to fix them."

    "## 4. Possible Causes of Slowness\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about a few different things that can make our computer slow. But of course, there's a lot more possible reasons. In this video, we'll do a rundown of some of the most common ones that you might come across in your IT role. Before we do, a quick reminder that when trying to diagnose why a computer is slow, we should use the process of elimination that we looked at earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first look for the simplest explanations that are the easiest to check. And after eliminating a possible root cause, we go back to the problem and come up with the next possible cause to check. So when trying to figure out what's making a computer slow, the first step is to look into when the computer is slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Software\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's slow when starting up, it's probably a sign that there are too many applications configured to start on boot. In this case, fixing the problem is just a question of going through the list of programs that start automatically and disabling any that aren't really needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "If instead the computer becomes sluggish after days of running just fine, and the problem goes away with a reboot, it means that there's a program that's keeping some state while running that's causing the computer to slow down. For example, this can happen if a program stores some data in memory and the data keeps growing over time, without deleting old values. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a program like this stays running for many days, the data might grow so much that reading it becomes slow and the computer runs out of RAM. This is almost certainly a bug in the program. And the ideal solution for a problem like this is to change the code so that it frees up some of the memory used. If you don't have access to the code, another option is to schedule a regular restart to mitigate both the slow program and your computer running out of RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar problem that can trigger after a long time using an application, and that isn't solved by a reboot, is that the files that an application is handling have grown too large. So when the program needs to read those files, it gets really slow. Again, this generally points to a bug in the way the program was designed because it didn't expect the files to grow so large. The best solution in this case is to fix the bug. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what can you do if you can't modify the code of the program? You can try to reduce the size of the files involved. If the file is a log file, you can use a program like **logrotate** to do this for you. For other formats, you might need to write your own tool to rotate the contents. Another data point that we can use to diagnose what's going on is whether this happens for all users of the application or just a subset of them. If only some users are affected, we'll want to know if there's something that's configured differently on those computers that might be triggering the slowness. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, many operating systems include a feature that tracks the files in our computer so it's easy and fast to search for them. This feature can be really useful when looking for something on a computer, but can get in the way of everyday use if we have tons of files and not the most powerful hardware. We've called out before that reading from the network is notably slower than reading from disk. It's common for computers in an office network to use a file system that's mounted over the network so they can share files across computers. This normally works just fine, but can make some programs really slow if they're doing a lot of reads and writes on this network-mounted file system.  To fix this, we'll need to make sure that the directory used by the program to read and write most of its data is a directory local to the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware failures can also cause our computer to become slow. If your hard drive has errors, the computer might still be able to apply error correction to get the data that it needs, but it will affect the overall performance. And once a hard drive starts having errors, it's only a matter of time until they're bad enough that data starts getting lost, so it's worth keeping an eye out for them. To do this, we can use some of the OS utilities that diagnose problems on hard drives or on RAM, and check if there's anything that could be causing problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3  Malicious Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another source of slowness is malicious software. Of course, we always want to keep your computer clean of any malicious software, but we can feel the effects of malicious software even if they aren't installed. For example, you might have come across a website that includes scripts, either in the website's content or the ads displayed, that use our processor to mine for cryptocurrency. Malicious browser extensions also fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there's a lot of possible reasons that could cause our computer to run slowly. Whenever we have to fix an issue like this, we need to look at what the bottleneck is, figure out the root cause behind the resource being used up, and then take appropriate action. Up next, we'll do a practical exercise of figuring out why our computer is slow and solving the issue."
