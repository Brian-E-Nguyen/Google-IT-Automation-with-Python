    "# Slow Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Writing Efficient Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In your role as an IT specialist or systems' administrator, you'll likely need to write scripts to automate tasks. A piece of code may start as a simple script that does a single thing, but end up growing into a complex program that handles many different tasks, and no matter the size and complexity of our code, we usually want it to perform well. In this and the next few videos, we'll discuss some ideas for how to make our code more efficient and how to figure out what needs fixing if it's slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**One important thing to keep in mind though is that we should always start by writing clear code that does what it should and only try to make it faster if we realize that it's not fast enough.** If it takes you 10 minutes to write a script that will run in five seconds, and 20 minutes to write a script that will do the same but takes three seconds, does it make a difference? It all depends on how often you run the script. If you run it once a day, the two seconds deference definitely won't justify the additional 10 minutes of work. But if you're going to run the same script for the 500 computers on your network, that small difference means it will take 15 less minutes to run the whole script. So overall, you're gaining time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's pretty hard to know in advance how fast your script will be and how long it will take you to make it faster. But as a rule, we aim first to write code that's readable, easy to maintain and easy to understand, because that lets us write code with less bugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there's something that's super slow, then yes, it makes sense to fix it, particularly if the script will be executed frequently enough that making it faster will save you more time than the time you spend optimizing it. But remember, **trying to optimize every second out of a script is probably not worth your time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, with that said, let's dive into how we can make our code more efficient. The first step is to keep in mind that we can't really make our computer go faster. **If we want our code to finish faster, we need to make our computer do less work,** and to do this, we'll have to avoid doing work that isn't really needed. How? There's a bunch of different things to do. The most common ones include storing data that was already calculated to avoid calculating it again using the right data structures for the problem and reorganizing the code so that the computer can stay busy while waiting for information from slow sources like disk or over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To know what sources of slowness we need to address, we have to figure out where our code is spending most of its time. There's a bunch of tools that can help us with that called profilers. A **profiler** *is a tool that measures the resources that our code is using, giving us a better understanding of what's going on.* In particular, they help us see how the memory is allocated and how the time spent. Because of how profilers work, they are specific to each programming language. So we would use `gprof` to analyze a C program but use the c-Profile module to analyze a Python program. Using tools like these, we can see which functions are called by our program, how many times each function was called and how much time are programs spent on each of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can find for example, that our program is calling a function more times than we originally intended or that a function that we thought would be fast is actually slow. To fix our code, we'll probably need to restructure it to avoid repeating expensive actions. What do we mean by expensive? In this context, expensive actions are those that take a long time to complete. Expensive operations include parsing a file, reading data over the network or iterating through a whole list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. How do we modify our code to avoid expensive operations? We'll discuss a few strategies in our next videos."

    "## 2. Using the Right Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good understanding of the data structures available to us can help us avoid unnecessary expensive operations and create efficient scripts. In particular, we'll want to understand the performance of those structures under different conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the introductory course to Python, you learned about a bunch of different data structures available in Python like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each of them have their uses, their advantages, and disadvantages. Let's do a very quick recap of lists and dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are sequences of elements. We can add, remove, or modify the elements in them. We can iterate through the whole list to operate on each of the elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different programming languages call them differently. The structure is called ArrayList in Java, Vector in C++, Array in Ruby, and Slice in Go. All these names refer to the same data structure that's fast to add or remove elements at the end. But adding or removing elements in the middle can be slow because all the elements that follow need to be repositioned. It's fast to access the element in a specific position in the list, but finding an element in an unknown position requires going through the whole list. This can be super slow if the list is long. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary store key value pairs. We add data by associating a value to a key. Then, we retrieve a value by looking up a specific key. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are called HashMap in Java, Unordered Map in C++, Hash in Ruby, and Map in Go. The map part in those names comes from how we're creating a mapping between a key and a value. The Hash part comes from the fact that to make the structure efficient, a hashing function is used internally to decide how the elements will be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main characteristic of this structure is that it's super-fast for looking up keys. Once we have our data stored in a dictionary, we can find the value associated to a key in just one operation. If it were stored in a list, we need to iterate through the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 What to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "So as a rule of thumb, if you need to access elements by position or will always iterate through all the elements, use a list to store them. This could be a list of all computers in the network, of all employees in the company, or of all products currently on sale for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, if we need to look up the elements using a key, we'll use a dictionary. This could be the data associated to a user which we'd look up using their username, the IP associated to a computer using the host name, or the data associated to a product using the internal product code. Whenever we need to do a bunch of these lookup operations, creating a dictionary and using it to get the data will take a lot less time than iterating over a list to find what we're looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it doesn't make sense to create a dictionary and fill it with data if we're only going to look up one value in it. In that case, we're wasting time creating the structure when we could just iterate over the list and get the element we're looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that we might want to think twice about is creating copies of the structures that we have in memory. If these structures are big, it can be pretty expensive to create those copies. So we should double-check if the copy is really needed. All right. Now, that we have a better understanding of when to use each data structure and what actions to avoid, we can look into how to deal with expensive loops. That's coming up in our next video."
