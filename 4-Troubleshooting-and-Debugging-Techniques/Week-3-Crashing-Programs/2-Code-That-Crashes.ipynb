    "# Code that Crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Accessing Invalid Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier videos, we looked into a bunch of different things that can make software crash and what we can do about them when we can't fix the code. If we're able to make the application behave correctly though, we'll have a lot more options for dealing with the crash. Of course to apply these fixes, we'll need to understand why the crash is even happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason a program crashes is it's trying to access invalid memory. To understand what this means, let's quickly explain how using the memory works on modern operating systems. Each process running on our computer asks the operating system for a chunk of memory. This is the memory used to store values and do operations on them during the program's execution. The OS keeps a mapping table of which process is assigned which portion of the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processes aren't allowed to read or write outside of the portions of memory they were assigned. **So accessing invalid memory means that the process tried to access a portion of the system's memory that wasn't assigned to it.** Now, how does this even happen? During normal working conditions, applications will request a portion of the memory and then use the space at the OS assigned to them. But programming errors might lead to a process trying to read or write to a memory address outside of the valid range. When this happens, the OS will raise an error like segmentation fault or general protection fault. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img17](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/Week-3-Crashing-Programs/img/img17.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of programming error is this? It typically happens with low-level languages like C or C++ where the programmer needs to take care of requesting the memory that the program is going to use and then giving that memory back once it's not needed anymore. In these languages, *the variables that store memory addresses are called* **pointers.** They're just like any other variable and code that can be modified as needed. So if a pointer is set to a value outside of the valid memory range for that process, it will point to invalid memory. If the code then tries to access the memory the pointer points to, the application will crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common programming errors that lead to segmentation faults or segfaults include forgetting to initialize a variable, trying to access a list element outside of the valid range, trying to use a portion of memory after having given it back, and trying to write more data than the requested portion of memory can hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what can you do if you have a program that's seg vaulting? The best way to understand what's going on is to attach a debugger to the faulty program. This way when the program crashes, you'll get information about the function where the fault happened. You'll know the parameters that the function received and find out the address that was invalid. That might already be enough to understand the problem. Maybe a certain variable is being initialized to late or the code is trying to read too many items on a list. If that's not enough, the debugger can give you a lot more detail on what the application is doing and why the memories invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this to be possible, we'll need our program to be compiled with **debugging symbols.** This means that on top of the information that the computer uses to execute the program, the executable binary needs to include extra information needed for debugging, like the names of the variables and functions being used. These symbols are usually stripped away from the binaries that we run to make them smaller. So we'll need to either recompile the binary to include the symbols, or download the debugging symbols from the provider of the software if they're available. Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu ships separate packages with the debugging symbols for all the packages in the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to debug and application that's segfaulting, we download the debugging symbols for that application. Attach a debugger to it, and see where the fault occurs. When doing this, we might find that the crash happens inside a call to a library function. This is separate from the application itself, so we need to install the debugging symbols for that library. We might need to repeat this cycle a few times before we can identify the portion of the code that's buggy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft compilers can also generate debugging symbols in a separate PDB file. Some Windows software providers let users download the PDP files that correspond to their binaries to let them properly debug failures. One of the trickiest things about this invalid memory business is that we're usually dealing with **undefined behavior.** *This means that the code is doing something that's not valid in the programming language.* The actual outcome will depend on the compiler used, how the operating system assigns memory to processes, and even the version of the libraries in use. A program that runs fine on a computer running Windows trigger a segfault on a computer running Linux and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to understand problems related to handling invalid memory, valgrind can help us a lot. **Valgrind** *is a very powerful tool that can tell us if the code is doing any invalid operations no matter if it crashes are not.* Valgrind lets us know if the code is accessing variables before initializing them. If the code is failing to free some of the memory requested, if the pointers are pointing to an invalid memory address, and a ton more things. Valgrind is available on Linux and Mac OS, and **Dr. Memory** is a similar tool that can be used on both Windows and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "So all of that said, what do we do when we finally discover the cause of the segfaults? You'll want to either change the code yourself or get the developers to fix the problem in the next version. This might sound scary if you've never programmed in the language used by the application. But when you know what's wrong with the code, it's usually not that hard to figure out how to fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is initialized too late, fixing the problem can be as easy as moving the initialization to the right part of the code, or if a loop is accessing an item outside of the length of the list, you might solve the issue by checking that there aren't more iterations than needed. Throughout this program, we've been teaching you these concepts so you can apply them to any piece of code no matter which language the program is using. So don't be afraid to put this into practice. You've got the skills for it. If the program is part of an open source project, you might find that someone else has already done the work, and so you can apply a patch available online. If there's no patch and you can't say you're the bug out yourself, you can always get in touch with the developers and ask a fake and fix the issue and create the necessary patch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In high-level languages like Python, the interpreter will almost certainly catch these problems itself. It will then throw an exception instead of letting the invalid memory access reach the operating system. But still those exceptions can be pretty annoying. We'll talk about those in our next video."

    "## 2. Unhandled Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last video, we talked a lot about what happens when a program tries to access invalid memory. Correctly handling memory is a hard problem, and that's why there's a bunch of different programming languages like Python, Java, or Ruby that do it for us. But that doesn't mean programs written in these languages can't trigger weird problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these languages, when a program comes across an unexpected condition that isn't correctly handled in the code, it will trigger errors or exceptions. In Python, for example, we could get an index error if we tried to access an element after the end of a list. We might get a **type error** or an **attribute error** if we try to take an action on a variable that wasn't properly initialized or **division by zero error** if we tried to well, divide by zero. When the code generates one of these errors without handling it properly, the program will finish unexpectedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, unhandled errors happen because the codes making wrong assumptions maybe the program's trying to access a resource that's not present or the code assumes that the user will enter a value but the user entered and empty string instead. Or maybe the application is trying to convert a value from one format to another and the value doesn't match the initial expectations. When these failures happen, the interpreter that's running the program will print the type of error, the line that caused the failure, and the traceback. The **traceback** *shows the lines of the different functions that were being executed when the problem happened.* In lots of cases, the error message and traceback info already gives us enough to understand what's going on, and we can move on to solving the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "But sadly, that's not always the case. The fact that a piece of code crashes on one function doesn't mean that the error is necessarily in that function. It's possible, for example, that the problem was caused by a function called earlier which set a variable to a bad value. So the function where the code crashes is just accessing that variable. So when the error message isn't enough, we'll need to debug the code to find out where things are going wrong. For that, we can use the debugging tools available for the application's language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a Python, program we can use the **PDB interactive debugger** which lets us do all the typical debugging actions like executing lines of code one-by-one or looking at how the variables change values. When we're trying to understand what's up with a misbehaving function on top of using debuggers, it's common practice to add statements that print data related to the codes execution. Statements like these could show the contents of variables, the return values of functions or metadata like the length of a list or size of a file. This technique is called **print f debugging.** The name comes from the print f function used to print messages to the screen in the C programming language. But we can use this technique in all languages, no matter if we use `print, puts, or echo` to display the text on the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this one step further. When changing code to print messages to the screen, the best approach is to add the messages in a way that can be easily enabled or disabled depending on whether we want the debug info or not. In Python, we can do this using the **logging** module. This module, lets us set how comprehensive we want our code to be. We can say whether we want to include all debug messages, or only info warning or error messages. Then when printing the message, we specify what type of message we're printing. That way, we can change the debug level with a flag or configuration setting. So you figured out why the unexpected exception was thrown, what do you do next? The solution might be fixing the programming error like making sure variables are initialized before they're used or that the code doesn't try to access elements after the end of a list. Or it could be that certain use cases that hadn't been considered needs to be added to the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you'll want to make the program more resilient to failures. Instead of crashing unexpectedly, you want the program to inform the user of the problem and tell them what they need to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you have an application that crashes with a permission denied error. Rather than the program finishing unexpectedly, you'll want to modify the code to catch that error and tell the user what the permission problem is so they can fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, unable to write new files and temp, make sure your user has bright permissions on temp. In some cases, it doesn't make sense for our program to even run if certain conditions aren't met. In that case, it's okay for the program to finish when the error is triggered. But again, it should do so in a way that tells the user what to do to fix the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if it's critical for an application to connect to a database but the database server isn't responding, it makes sense for the application to finish with an error saying unable to connect to the database server. It also makes sense to include all details of the attempted connection like the host name, the port, or the username used to connect. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap, if your program is crashing with an unhandled error, you want to first do some debugging to figure out what's causing the issue. Once you figured it out, you want to make sure that you fix any programming errors and that you catch any conditions that may trigger an error. This way, you can make sure the program doesn't crash and leave your users frustrated. Up next, we'll talk a bit about what you can do when you're trying to fix someone else's code"

    "## 3. Fixing Someone Else's Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In our IT jobs, it's pretty common to have to fix problems and code that we didn't write ourselves. It might be because we're working with a program that's open-source or with a program that was developed by someone else inside the company. When this happens, we need to spend some time getting acquainted with the code so that we can understand what's going on. Let's do a rundown of some things that can help us with that. If the code has comments and the functions are well-documented, reading these is a great place to start when trying to figure out what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember way back in the course when we first introduced Python, we talked about the importance of developing good habits when we're writing code. Writing good comments is one of those good habits that pays off when trying to understand code written by others and also your past self. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, a lot of code doesn't include enough comments, leaving us to try to understand it without enough context. If that's the case, you can improve things by adding comments as you read the code and figure out what it's doing. Writing these comments help you solidify your understanding. If you contribute those comments back to the original developers, you can help anybody else trying to understand the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that can help to understand someone else's code is reading the tests associated to the code. Well-written tests can tell us what each function is expected to do. Looking at the existing tests can show us which use cases weren't taken into account. But what if there aren't enough tests? Just like with writing extra comments, writing some tests of your own can help you better see what the code is supposed to do and improve overall quality of the code. This can also be really useful when modifying the original code. To ensure that changes you make, don't break the rest of the functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my job, I need to make changes to code written by other people a lot. I definitely read the comments and sometimes reference the tests too. But in the end, to really understand what's going on, I just have to read through the code. But how do you even start reading through someone else's code? This depends a bit on personal preference and the size of the project. If there are only a couple of 100 lines of code, it's feasible to read all of them. But when the project has thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code, you can't really read the whole thing. You'll need to focus on the functions or modules that are part of the problem that you're trying to fix. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible approach in this case, would be to start with the function where the error happened, then the function or functions that call it, and so on until you can grasp the contexts that led to the problem. While this is of course much easier if it's in a programming language that you're familiar with, you don't need to be an expert in the language to fix a bug in the program. If you've come across an error and debug the issue well enough to understand what's going on, you might be able to fix the problem even if you've never seen that language before. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of those skills that gets better with practice. So it might make sense to you to start practicing before you need to fix a problem in the code. Take a program that you both use and have access to its code and figure out how it does a specific action. Follow the code until you really understand what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could take the web server software you're using and check out how it parses its configuration files, or take a look at one Python module you like, like Python Request for example, and figure out how it processes the data it receives. Doing this, you can get used to reading code written by others and understanding what it's doing. Another option is to pick an open-source project that you use. Look at the list of open issues and to have a go at fixing an easy one. To do that, you'll need to find your way around the code, understand what it's doing and what to change. By practicing doing this, you'll improve your ability to quickly figure out what the code does and what needs to be changed, while helping improve the project's overall quality. Up next, we'll get some practice fixing issues and a couple of different programs that crash."

We need to tell the OS that we want to generate those core files.

It shows that the crash happened inside the strlen function in a file that's part of the system libraries. The no such file or directory error that we're seeing here means that we don't have the debugging symbols for that system library, but that's okay. We trust the strlen function to work correctly.

Zero is never a valid pointer. It usually signals the end of data structures in C. So our code is trying to access the second element in the array, but the array only has one valid element. In other words, the for loop is doing one iteration to many. This is known as an off-by-one error, and it's a super common error. In this case, the fix is really simple. We need to change the less than or equal sign to be a strictly less than sign so that the iteration stops one element before.

    "In our last video, we looked into an application that was crashing with a segmentation fault. That kind of problem is common when dealing with applications written in languages like C or C++. On the flip side, when using languages like Python, we usually need to deal with unexpected exceptions making our program crash. Let's look at one example of that. We have a script that updates the descriptions of some products in our company's database. It's a pretty simple script that takes a CSV file as a parameter, which includes the data that needs to be imported using the product code and description. Our script simply reads through a file and then updates the database. Most of the time it works just fine. But when the file with the new descriptions is generated by one specific user, the program fails with an exception. The user has sent us a file that's failing so that we can try to figure out what's going on. Let's first check out the contents of the file.\n",

    "\n",
    "Above that, we see a list of function calls with two lines per function. The first line tells us the Python file that contains the function, the line number, and the name of the function. The second line shows us the contents of that line. This information is similar to the back-trace that we saw in our last video. But the order of the functions is reversed. The function at the bottom, update data, is the one where the exception occurred. Above it, we see that update data was called by main, and on top of that we see that main was called by the line at the module level. \n",

    "So what's going on here? The update data function is trying to access the product code fields in a variable named row. But for some reason this is failing with a Key Error. Frequently, knowing the exception message and the line where the exception happened, is already enough to understand what's going on. But in some cases like this one, that's not enough. It's time to try our hand at using a Python debugger. We'll start the debugger by running pdb3 and then passing the script that we want to run and any parameters that our script needs. \n",

    "In our case, we'll call pdb3 update products.py new products.csv. When we start the debugger it gets positioned at the first line of our script and waits for us to tell it what to do. We could run each of the instructions in the file one by one using the next command. But there's a lot going on here. So we need to go through a lot of lines until we reach the failure. Alternatively, we can tell the debugger to continue the execution until it either finishes or crashes. Let's do that now.\n",

But some programs still include it and this is tripping up our script. So what can we do? Fortunately, others have already faced the same issue and figured out a solution. There is a special value called UTF-8-sig that we can set as the encoding parameter of the open function. Setting this encoding means that Python will get rid of the BOM when files include it and behave as usual when they don't. Let's change the code of our script to use that encoding instead of the default. We'll look for the place where it's opening the file, then add the encoding parameter with UTF-8-sig as the value.\n",

Like setting breakpoints the letter code run until certain line of code is executed or watch points that letter code run until a variable or expression changes. We can also step through the code instruction by instruction to check when a problem happens and much more. We won't look into any of these advanced techniques here. But as usual, we'll put more information about this in the next reading in case you want to learn more.
