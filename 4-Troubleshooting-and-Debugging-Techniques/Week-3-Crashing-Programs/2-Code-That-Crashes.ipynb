    "## 1. Accessing Invalid Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier videos, we looked into a bunch of different things that can make software crash and what we can do about them when we can't fix the code. If we're able to make the application behave correctly though, we'll have a lot more options for dealing with the crash. Of course to apply these fixes, we'll need to understand why the crash is even happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason a program crashes is it's trying to access invalid memory. To understand what this means, let's quickly explain how using the memory works on modern operating systems. Each process running on our computer asks the operating system for a chunk of memory. This is the memory used to store values and do operations on them during the program's execution. The OS keeps a mapping table of which process is assigned which portion of the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processes aren't allowed to read or write outside of the portions of memory they were assigned. **So accessing invalid memory means that the process tried to access a portion of the system's memory that wasn't assigned to it.** Now, how does this even happen? During normal working conditions, applications will request a portion of the memory and then use the space at the OS assigned to them. But programming errors might lead to a process trying to read or write to a memory address outside of the valid range. When this happens, the OS will raise an error like segmentation fault or general protection fault. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img17](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/Week-3-Crashing-Programs/img/img17.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of programming error is this? It typically happens with low-level languages like C or C++ where the programmer needs to take care of requesting the memory that the program is going to use and then giving that memory back once it's not needed anymore. In these languages, *the variables that store memory addresses are called* **pointers.** They're just like any other variable and code that can be modified as needed. So if a pointer is set to a value outside of the valid memory range for that process, it will point to invalid memory. If the code then tries to access the memory the pointer points to, the application will crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common programming errors that lead to segmentation faults or segfaults include forgetting to initialize a variable, trying to access a list element outside of the valid range, trying to use a portion of memory after having given it back, and trying to write more data than the requested portion of memory can hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what can you do if you have a program that's seg vaulting? The best way to understand what's going on is to attach a debugger to the faulty program. This way when the program crashes, you'll get information about the function where the fault happened. You'll know the parameters that the function received and find out the address that was invalid. That might already be enough to understand the problem. Maybe a certain variable is being initialized to late or the code is trying to read too many items on a list. If that's not enough, the debugger can give you a lot more detail on what the application is doing and why the memories invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this to be possible, we'll need our program to be compiled with **debugging symbols.** This means that on top of the information that the computer uses to execute the program, the executable binary needs to include extra information needed for debugging, like the names of the variables and functions being used. These symbols are usually stripped away from the binaries that we run to make them smaller. So we'll need to either recompile the binary to include the symbols, or download the debugging symbols from the provider of the software if they're available. Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu ships separate packages with the debugging symbols for all the packages in the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to debug and application that's segfaulting, we download the debugging symbols for that application. Attach a debugger to it, and see where the fault occurs. When doing this, we might find that the crash happens inside a call to a library function. This is separate from the application itself, so we need to install the debugging symbols for that library. We might need to repeat this cycle a few times before we can identify the portion of the code that's buggy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft compilers can also generate debugging symbols in a separate PDB file. Some Windows software providers let users download the PDP files that correspond to their binaries to let them properly debug failures. One of the trickiest things about this invalid memory business is that we're usually dealing with **undefined behavior.** *This means that the code is doing something that's not valid in the programming language.* The actual outcome will depend on the compiler used, how the operating system assigns memory to processes, and even the version of the libraries in use. A program that runs fine on a computer running Windows trigger a segfault on a computer running Linux and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to understand problems related to handling invalid memory, valgrind can help us a lot. **Valgrind** *is a very powerful tool that can tell us if the code is doing any invalid operations no matter if it crashes are not.* Valgrind lets us know if the code is accessing variables before initializing them. If the code is failing to free some of the memory requested, if the pointers are pointing to an invalid memory address, and a ton more things. Valgrind is available on Linux and Mac OS, and **Dr. Memory** is a similar tool that can be used on both Windows and Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "So all of that said, what do we do when we finally discover the cause of the segfaults? You'll want to either change the code yourself or get the developers to fix the problem in the next version. This might sound scary if you've never programmed in the language used by the application. But when you know what's wrong with the code, it's usually not that hard to figure out how to fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is initialized too late, fixing the problem can be as easy as moving the initialization to the right part of the code, or if a loop is accessing an item outside of the length of the list, you might solve the issue by checking that there aren't more iterations than needed. Throughout this program, we've been teaching you these concepts so you can apply them to any piece of code no matter which language the program is using. So don't be afraid to put this into practice. You've got the skills for it. If the program is part of an open source project, you might find that someone else has already done the work, and so you can apply a patch available online. If there's no patch and you can't say you're the bug out yourself, you can always get in touch with the developers and ask a fake and fix the issue and create the necessary patch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In high-level languages like Python, the interpreter will almost certainly catch these problems itself. It will then throw an exception instead of letting the invalid memory access reach the operating system. But still those exceptions can be pretty annoying. We'll talk about those in our next video."
