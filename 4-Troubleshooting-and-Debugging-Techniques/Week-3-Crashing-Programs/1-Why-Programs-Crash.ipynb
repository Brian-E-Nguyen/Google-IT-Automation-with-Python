    "# Why Programs Crash\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Intro to Module 3: Crashing Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back and congratulations on making it here. In the last module, we learned about a bunch of things that can make our computer, our code, or our systems run slow. We looked into the root causes and the possible remedies that might improve performance. You're sure not suffering from slowness, you've already zoomed through the first half of the course. Great job. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll look at another area of IT that often keeps us busy. The many things that can cause programs to crash unexpectedly. If you've used computers, you've seen software crash at one time or another. A program terminates unexpectedly, a device reboots for no apparent reason, the operating system hangs and we lose all our unsaved work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my job, I've had to deal with my fair share of crashing applications; programs that terminate with uncaught exceptions, systems that fail to update to the latest version, jobs that silently die and I'm left wondering what happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not long ago, I had to debug a program that was crashing every few days. This program parsed logs to generate alerts when it found suspicious events. When the task crashed, everything being processed was dropped. The task was then restarted and the log files reprocessed. So while no data was actually loss, the reoccurring crashes were increasing the average time to process the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, I first follow the code to understand what it did. That led me to figure out the problem. The program was starting a bunch of threads but never closing them, so it eventually ran out of memory and crashed. I was then able to fix it by making sure all threads got cleaned up once they've completed their task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the cause of these crashes is that the software ran into an unexpected situation, a state that the developers didn't anticipate. Because these are unexpected situations, they can be triggered by very broad range of things. It could be a hardware problem, like a broken ramjet that causes a program to get invalid data when trying to access the memory. There could be a bug in some part of the code, which does an unsupported operation, like trying to read an element from an empty list. It could be an issue in the overall system, like if a program expects a certain library to be present or a certain directory to exist, but they don't or there could be a problem with the input provided by the user. Like if we ask the user to enter a number and they enter a string instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list goes on. There are a ton of things that can cause a crash. Instead of knowing all of them, we need to learn to reduce the scope of the problem so that we can get to the bottom of it. In the next few videos, we'll learn a bunch of different techniques that we can use to understand the root causes and how to fix them, or at least lessen the damage when fixing is not possible. We'll first look at how we can understand the problem. We'll then check out what we can do when we don't have access to change the program's code, and what we can do when we do have access to the source code, even if it's not our own code. Finally, we'll also look at what to do when the problem isn't just one computer crashing, but a larger incident affecting complex systems. We'll also dive into how to document a problem and it's solutions, and how to learn from our mistakes by writing postmortems. As usual, we'll put all this knowledge into action by solving real-world problems. You'll have the opportunity to try fixing a complex crashing problem by the end of the module. Let's get going."

    "## 2. Systems That Crash\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a ton of different reasons why applications crash. When we come across a program that terminates unexpectedly, we go through our usual cycle of gathering information about the crash, digging in until we find the root cause, and then applying the right fix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example that a user asks for your help with a problem on their computer. When you ask for details, the user tells you that the internal billing application crashed while they were trying to generate an invoice for a customer. Now, this could be caused by lots of different things. So what you need to do is reduce the scope of the problem, and remember, you want to start with the actions that are easier and faster to check. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, you tried looking at the logs to see if there's any error that may point to what's happening, but you only find an error saying application terminated and no useful information. So you check if the user can reproduce the problem by doing this same action on a different computer. You ask the user to try this out, and it turns out on a different machine that can generate the invoice just fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that means that the problem just has to do with the installation or configuration on that specific computer. Great news. You've already reduced the scope to something machine-specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that you might want to check is if this happens reliably. Do all invoice generations fail? Is it confined to one specific product or customer? For this example, let's say that when you ask the user to try generating other invoices, it works just fine even for the same customer. Okay, you think maybe this problem was with a specific order for that specific customer on that specific computer. That's rather suspicious, but not so fast. The user tells you that after creating all the invoices for the day, they tried to generate a report, and the application crashed again. But then it worked the next time. You double-check with other users and find out the application isn't crashing when they use it. So what does this mean? The application seems to be crashing randomly but only on that computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further reduce the scope, you'll want to know if it's just that application or the whole system. To check this out, you can try moving away the local configuration for the program and using the default configuration instead, or maybe even reinstalling the application. You might also ask the user if they've seen crashes on any other application. For this example, let's say that reinstalling the application and running it with the default configuration still leads to random crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm impressed to remember, the user tells you that their web browser also crashed last week when they were using the internal webmail. At this point, the information points to a problem in the overall system, either the hardware or the OS installation. If you have a spare computer available, it might make sense to give one to the user at this point so that they can go back to work while you try to figure out the root cause of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can you do to further reduce the scope? By now, there's a high likelihood if the problem being hardware related. So one thing you could do is try taking the hard drive out of the computer and putting it into a different computer. This works best when you already have a spare case that you know works well so that you can use it for tests like these. That way you can quickly check if it's a problem with the data and the drive or the rest of the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that after putting the hard drive in the other computer, the applications run without unexpected crashes. This means that some hardware component is at fault. The next step is to find out which one. Given the random crashes, one thing to check would be the RAM. Memory chips deteriorate over time. When they do, the computer might write data to some part of the memory and then get a totally different value when trying to read it back. To check the health of our RAM, we can use the **memtest 86** tool to look for errors. We run this tool on boot instead of the normal operating system so that it can access all of the available memory and verify if the data written to memory is the same when it tries to read it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the RAM is fine, you can check if the computer's overheating by looking at the sensor data provided by the OS. If that's not the case, check if there's a problem with external devices like a graphics card or sound card. You can do this by disconnecting or replacing the devices present in the computer and checking if the crashes still occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can you do if when putting the hard drive in a separate computer, you still get the strange caches? This means the problem is in the drive itself or the OS installation. As with RAM, our hard drives age. At some point, the data that the computer reads stops matching what was originally stored. Each OS ships its own battery of hard drive checking tools, and you should familiarize yourself with ones in the OS you're working with. You'll want to look at the output of the tools that check the disk for bad sectors, and you'll also want to use these **S.M.A.R.T** tools which can help detect errors and even try to anticipate problems before they affect the computer's performance. What can you do with the hard-drive turns out to be fine? You'd need to look into the possible OS issues, but before doing that, ask yourself, is it worth it? Looking to what's wrong with the installation can take a lot of valuable time. If the installation is easy to replicate, then just reinstalling the OS might be faster and simpler than looking into why it broke. Alright, so that's a glimpse of how you can try to diagnose a system that's unstable and behaving in weird ways. But often, you'll be dealing with a specific application that's misbehaving. In this case, it's almost certainly above in the application's code that's not taking into account a situation that, though unexpected, can sometimes occur. Up next, we'll check out what you can do when that happens."
