    "# Why Programs Crash\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Intro to Module 3: Crashing Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back and congratulations on making it here. In the last module, we learned about a bunch of things that can make our computer, our code, or our systems run slow. We looked into the root causes and the possible remedies that might improve performance. You're sure not suffering from slowness, you've already zoomed through the first half of the course. Great job. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll look at another area of IT that often keeps us busy. The many things that can cause programs to crash unexpectedly. If you've used computers, you've seen software crash at one time or another. A program terminates unexpectedly, a device reboots for no apparent reason, the operating system hangs and we lose all our unsaved work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my job, I've had to deal with my fair share of crashing applications; programs that terminate with uncaught exceptions, systems that fail to update to the latest version, jobs that silently die and I'm left wondering what happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not long ago, I had to debug a program that was crashing every few days. This program parsed logs to generate alerts when it found suspicious events. When the task crashed, everything being processed was dropped. The task was then restarted and the log files reprocessed. So while no data was actually loss, the reoccurring crashes were increasing the average time to process the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, I first follow the code to understand what it did. That led me to figure out the problem. The program was starting a bunch of threads but never closing them, so it eventually ran out of memory and crashed. I was then able to fix it by making sure all threads got cleaned up once they've completed their task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the cause of these crashes is that the software ran into an unexpected situation, a state that the developers didn't anticipate. Because these are unexpected situations, they can be triggered by very broad range of things. It could be a hardware problem, like a broken ramjet that causes a program to get invalid data when trying to access the memory. There could be a bug in some part of the code, which does an unsupported operation, like trying to read an element from an empty list. It could be an issue in the overall system, like if a program expects a certain library to be present or a certain directory to exist, but they don't or there could be a problem with the input provided by the user. Like if we ask the user to enter a number and they enter a string instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list goes on. There are a ton of things that can cause a crash. Instead of knowing all of them, we need to learn to reduce the scope of the problem so that we can get to the bottom of it. In the next few videos, we'll learn a bunch of different techniques that we can use to understand the root causes and how to fix them, or at least lessen the damage when fixing is not possible. We'll first look at how we can understand the problem. We'll then check out what we can do when we don't have access to change the program's code, and what we can do when we do have access to the source code, even if it's not our own code. Finally, we'll also look at what to do when the problem isn't just one computer crashing, but a larger incident affecting complex systems. We'll also dive into how to document a problem and it's solutions, and how to learn from our mistakes by writing postmortems. As usual, we'll put all this knowledge into action by solving real-world problems. You'll have the opportunity to try fixing a complex crashing problem by the end of the module. Let's get going."

    "## 2. Systems That Crash\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a ton of different reasons why applications crash. When we come across a program that terminates unexpectedly, we go through our usual cycle of gathering information about the crash, digging in until we find the root cause, and then applying the right fix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example that a user asks for your help with a problem on their computer. When you ask for details, the user tells you that the internal billing application crashed while they were trying to generate an invoice for a customer. Now, this could be caused by lots of different things. So what you need to do is reduce the scope of the problem, and remember, you want to start with the actions that are easier and faster to check. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, you tried looking at the logs to see if there's any error that may point to what's happening, but you only find an error saying application terminated and no useful information. So you check if the user can reproduce the problem by doing this same action on a different computer. You ask the user to try this out, and it turns out on a different machine that can generate the invoice just fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that means that the problem just has to do with the installation or configuration on that specific computer. Great news. You've already reduced the scope to something machine-specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that you might want to check is if this happens reliably. Do all invoice generations fail? Is it confined to one specific product or customer? For this example, let's say that when you ask the user to try generating other invoices, it works just fine even for the same customer. Okay, you think maybe this problem was with a specific order for that specific customer on that specific computer. That's rather suspicious, but not so fast. The user tells you that after creating all the invoices for the day, they tried to generate a report, and the application crashed again. But then it worked the next time. You double-check with other users and find out the application isn't crashing when they use it. So what does this mean? The application seems to be crashing randomly but only on that computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further reduce the scope, you'll want to know if it's just that application or the whole system. To check this out, you can try moving away the local configuration for the program and using the default configuration instead, or maybe even reinstalling the application. You might also ask the user if they've seen crashes on any other application. For this example, let's say that reinstalling the application and running it with the default configuration still leads to random crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm impressed to remember, the user tells you that their web browser also crashed last week when they were using the internal webmail. At this point, the information points to a problem in the overall system, either the hardware or the OS installation. If you have a spare computer available, it might make sense to give one to the user at this point so that they can go back to work while you try to figure out the root cause of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can you do to further reduce the scope? By now, there's a high likelihood if the problem being hardware related. So one thing you could do is try taking the hard drive out of the computer and putting it into a different computer. This works best when you already have a spare case that you know works well so that you can use it for tests like these. That way you can quickly check if it's a problem with the data and the drive or the rest of the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that after putting the hard drive in the other computer, the applications run without unexpected crashes. This means that some hardware component is at fault. The next step is to find out which one. Given the random crashes, one thing to check would be the RAM. Memory chips deteriorate over time. When they do, the computer might write data to some part of the memory and then get a totally different value when trying to read it back. To check the health of our RAM, we can use the **memtest 86** tool to look for errors. We run this tool on boot instead of the normal operating system so that it can access all of the available memory and verify if the data written to memory is the same when it tries to read it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the RAM is fine, you can check if the computer's overheating by looking at the sensor data provided by the OS. If that's not the case, check if there's a problem with external devices like a graphics card or sound card. You can do this by disconnecting or replacing the devices present in the computer and checking if the crashes still occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can you do if when putting the hard drive in a separate computer, you still get the strange caches? This means the problem is in the drive itself or the OS installation. As with RAM, our hard drives age. At some point, the data that the computer reads stops matching what was originally stored. Each OS ships its own battery of hard drive checking tools, and you should familiarize yourself with ones in the OS you're working with. You'll want to look at the output of the tools that check the disk for bad sectors, and you'll also want to use these **S.M.A.R.T** tools which can help detect errors and even try to anticipate problems before they affect the computer's performance. What can you do with the hard-drive turns out to be fine? You'd need to look into the possible OS issues, but before doing that, ask yourself, is it worth it? Looking to what's wrong with the installation can take a lot of valuable time. If the installation is easy to replicate, then just reinstalling the OS might be faster and simpler than looking into why it broke. Alright, so that's a glimpse of how you can try to diagnose a system that's unstable and behaving in weird ways. But often, you'll be dealing with a specific application that's misbehaving. In this case, it's almost certainly above in the application's code that's not taking into account a situation that, though unexpected, can sometimes occur. Up next, we'll check out what you can do when that happens."

    "## 3. Understanding Crashing Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "When an application crashes and we don't know why we'll want to look for logs that might relate to the failure. To look at logs on Linux will open the system log files and VAR log or the user log files and dot accession errors file. On Mac OS we generally use the console app to look at logs and the event Viewer on Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what kind of data should you look for in these logs most logs have a date and time for each line locked knowing when the application crashed you can look for a log line around that time. And try to find an error message related to the application that crashed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the errors will be self-explanatory like permission denied no such file or directory connection refused. Sometimes it will be a cryptic message and you have no idea what it means. Ever we have an error message no matter how weird it seems we can search for it online to try to figure out its meaning. If we're lucky, we might find the official documentation of what that error means and what we can do about it. But even if that's not available, will usually come across posts by others who have tackled a similar error and this additional information can help us understand what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no errors or the errors aren't useful we can try to find out more info by enabling sling debug logging. Many applications generate a lot more output when debugging logging is enabled. We might need to enable it from a setting in the applications configuration file or a command line parameter to pass when running the application manually. By enabling this extra logging information, we can get a better idea of what's actually causing the problem. And what do we need to do if there are no logs or error messages at all. In that case we need to use tools that let us see what going on inside the program. We call that a few are ready. On Linux we use `strace` to see what system calls a programs doing. The equivalent tool is called `dtruss` on Mac OS, **process monitor** is a Windows tool that can also take a peek inside what's going on inside a process on Windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "By tracing which system calls a program is doing we can see what files and directories it's trying open what network connections it's trying to make and what information it's trying to read or write. This can give us a better idea of what caused the actual problem. We could find that the problem is caused by a resource not being present that the program expects to be present. Like we saw with the missing directory example in the earlier module or we could find that the program tries to interact with the graphics interface and there isn't any because it's a service running on a server. Or the program tries to open a file but the user running the software doesn't have the necessary permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the application used to work fine and recently started crashing. It's useful to look into what changed in between. The first thing is to check if the issue is caused by a new version of the application itself. Maybe there's a bug in the new version that causes the crash or maybe the way that we're using the application is no longer supported. But that's not the only possible change that could trigger crashes. It could also be that a library or service used by our application changed and they no longer work well together or it could be that there was a configuration change in the overall environment. Like if the user isn't in a specific group anymore or if the files that the application used are in a different location. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to figure out what changed logs can also be a useful source of information. In the system log we can check which programs and libraries were recently updated checking for configuration changes might be harder depending on how you manage that configuration. If the settings are managed through a configuration management system and the values are stored in a Version Control System. Then you might be able to look at the history of changes and figure out which one triggered the failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call that a few times already how important it is to have a reproduction case for a problem that we're trying to solve. When we're trying to debug an application that crashes finding a reproduction case can help us both understand what's causing the crash and figure out what we can do to fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it's valuable to spend some time figuring out the state that triggers the crash. This includes the overall system environment the specific application configuration the inputs to the application the outputs generated by the application the resources that uses and the services it communicates with. When trying create the reproduction case it might be useful to start from a clean slate and slowly put the pieces in place until the crash triggers. This might include trying out the application with the default configuration instead of the local one or on a freshly installed computer instead of the computer where it's crashing. And remember we want to make the reproduction case as small as possible this lets us better understand the problem and also quickly check if its present or not when we attempt to fix it. And even if we end up unable to fix the issue having a small and simple reproduction case is extremely helpful in reporting a bug to the program's developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So to sum this up to find the root cause of a crashing application will want to look at all available logs figure out what changed trace the system or library calls the program makes and create the smallest possible reproduction case.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing all of this, we should have some idea of what the root cause of the issue is and maybe even how to fix it. The strategy for fixing problems will depend on whether we can fix the code or not. In our next video, we'll check out what you can do when you can't fix the program and need to work around the issue. And in later videos, we'll deep dive into strategies for fixing faulty code."

    "## 4. What to do when you can't fix the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about working in IT is that we can tell the computer what to do and it will follow our orders. When dealing with unexpected behavior in the software written by other people though, we might not always be so lucky. It could be that we're dealing with proprietary software and the source code isn't available at all, or we might have access to the source code but it's written in a language that we don't understand and so we can't change it. No matter the reason, what can you do if you need to fix an application that crashes and you can't change the code. You'll need to figure out a way of working around the problem and avoiding the crash. The actual workaround will depend on what the issue is that you're trying to solve. Let's do a rundown of some of the available options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you figured out that the issue was caused by a specific data input that makes the application crash. The crashes only happen when the input isn't in the format the code expects. Some of your systems generate data in XML format which used to work fine with the previous version of the software but the new version now requires all data to be in a YAML format. In this case you can write a script that pre-processes the data and make sure that it's in the format that the program expects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if the problem is caused by an external service that the application uses and that's no longer compatible, we could write a service to act as a proxy and make sure that both sides see the requests and responses they expect. This type of compatibility layer is called a Wrapper. A **Wrapper** *is a function or program that provides a compatibility layer between two functions or programs so they can work well together.* Using Wrappers is a pretty common technique when the expected output and input formats don't match. So if you're faced with some sort of compatibility problem don't be afraid to write a Wrapper to work around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility you might need to look at is if the overall system environment is it working well with the application. In this case, you might want to check what environment the applications developers recommend and then modify your systems to match that. This could be running the same version of the operating system using the same version of the dynamic libraries or interacting with the same back end services. Say the application was developed and tested on Windows 7, if you run into problems while trying to run it under Windows 10, you might want to use Windows 7 instead or if the application was developed and tested for Ubuntu and you're having trouble running it under Fedora, you might want to try running it on Ubuntu instead, and what can you do if you can't make the environment match? This could happen, for example, if there's another application that requires a different version of the same library or you can't change a certain configuration setting because it's required to access a different service. In this case, you might want to consider running the application inside a virtual machine or maybe a **container.** These are two different things but we won't go into details of how they are different here. All you need to know right now is *they both let you run the affected application in its own environment without interfering with the rest of the system.* This is what we need if we want the environment to be different than the one other Applications are using on the same computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we can't find a way to stop an application from crashing but we can make sure that if it crashes it starts back again. To do this, we can deploy a **watchdog.** *This is a process that checks whether a program is running and when it's not starts the program again.* To implement this, we need to write a script that stays running in the background and periodically checks if the other program is running. Whenever the check fails the watchdog will trigger the program to restart. Doing this won't avoid the crash itself. But it will at least ensure that the service is available. This works well for services where availability matters more than running continuously and no matter how you work around the issue, remember to always report the bug to the application developers. As we called out, if you have a good reproduction case for your issue, it makes it easier for the developers to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. So when you report a bug make sure you include as much information as possible, share good reproduction case and answer the questions that we mentioned earlier on. \n",
