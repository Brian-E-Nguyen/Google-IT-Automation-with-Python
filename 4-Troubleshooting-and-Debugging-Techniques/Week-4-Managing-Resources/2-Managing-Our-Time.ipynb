    "## 1. Getting to the Important Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier videos, we discussed how to make better use of the resources available on our computers and systems, like the CPU, the memory, the disk, the network, and so on. But, there's another resource that's even more valuable in our day to day: **our time.** As humans, we want to make sure that we spend our time doing meaningful activities, like work that we enjoy, and earning the satisfaction of a job well done. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Eisenhower Decision Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "When working, we need to optimize the time we spend to bring the most value to the company. Finding the right balance is hard, but that's what we're here for. From updated calendars, to social media detoxes, there's lots of different ways to optimize our time. One that's super effective when working in IT is the **Eisenhower Decision Matrix.** When using this method, we split tasks into two different categories: urgent and important. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img12](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/Week-4-Managing-Resources/img/img12.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tasks that are important and urgent. Draw alarm bells around them if you'd like because these need to be done right away. For example, if the company's Internet connection is down, it's both urgent and important to get it back up as soon as possible. Some tasks are important, but not urgent, so they need to get done at some point even if it takes a while to complete them. For example, as a follow-up to the network being down, it would be important to make sure that there's a backup network connection so that if the existing one is ever down again, the company can stay connected using the backup. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other tasks might seem urgent, but aren't really important. A lot of the interruptions that we need to deal with are in this category. Answering email, phone calls, texts, or instant messages feel like something that we need to do right away. But most of the time are not really the best use of our time. Finally, there's a whole category of tasks that are neither important nor urgent. These are distractions and time wasters, they shouldn't be done at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img13](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/4-Troubleshooting-and-Debugging-Techniques/Week-4-Managing-Resources/img/img13.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "These include: meetings where nothing useful is being discussed, email threads that lead to nowhere, office gossip, no thanks, and any other tasks that eat up our time without giving anything valuable in return. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, to make the most of our time, we need to make sure that we're spending the majority of it on tasks that are important. Of course we'll want to get to the urgent tasks as soon as possible, but we need to block some time for long-term planning and execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spending time on long-term tasks might not bear fruit right away, but it can be critical when dealing with a large incident. For example, setting up your infrastructure so that you can easily roll back changes or deploy new servers when needed takes a large chunk of time. But investing in the future can save you even more time and user frustration when responding to a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researching new technologies is another task in this category. IT is always evolving and it's important to have time set aside to stay up to date. Figure out if it's time to migrate the web server to different software, update the mail server to a new OS version, or deploy voice-over IP throughout your company. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Technical Debt\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important task that might not necessarily be urgent is solving technical debt. When you work in IT, you waste time a lot. What does it mean? **Technical debt** *is the pending work that accumulates when we choose a quick-and-easy solution instead of applying a sustainable long-term one.* We call that a few times already though in solving the problem we might apply a short-term remediation to fix it right away, and then plan for a long-term solution to prevent it from happening in the future. Until we have fixed that sticks, the workaround we created is technical debt because we need to spend time keeping it in place even if it's not the best solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we go for short-term solution and leave the long-term solution for later, we're creating technical debt. This might be the right decision in the moment to get us out of a crisis and let our users get back to work, but we need to unscheduled time to apply the long-term solution that will make our future lives easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technical debt can also be generated by external parties. For example, when a new version of the software we're using is released, will need to schedule time to upgrade it. Until we do, that pending upgrade is technical debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Dealing with Interruptions\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've made it clear that we need to focus our work on tasks that are important, but what can we do about interruptions which are urgent but not important? If you work in IT support, you have to be interrupted, it's part of the role. So you'll need to plan to deal with those interruptions effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you work on a team, you can rotate the person dealing with those interruptions. Maybe someone takes care of them in the morning and a different person in the afternoon, or you take turns each day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you work independently, you can try to establish a set of ours when users can expect to reach you for a normal requests, and the rest of the time only be available for emergencies. The key here is to have a window of time reserved when you're not going to be interrupted. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's the time when you can get the most important tasks done when you can fully concentrate on dealing with complex issues and finding solutions for tricky problems. Depending on your role and how the company works, you might need to get this work done in a different location to avoid people walking up to your desk, or actively silencing any of your notifications to avoid getting interrupted and distracted by unimportant conversations. So assuming that you've managed to set some time aside to work on these important but not urgent tasks, how do you make sure that you work on the right things with the right priorities? That's coming up in our next video."

    "## 2. Prioritizing Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last video, we talked about how we need to make sure that we have the time available to work on tasks that are important, but not necessarily urgent. But sometimes it feels like everything is important, and everything is urgent. Say you need to deploy a new computer for the person that's starting tomorrow. Upgrade the VPN service to the latest version because the old one has a security vulnerability. Fix a permissions problem that's preventing a group of users from accessing the inventory data. Check out a problem with the mail system that's causing some emails to get randomly rejected. And so many other things that by now you've lost track of them. What can you do to figure out how to spend the limited time that you have? There's a lot to say about this, and everyone works a little differently. So you'll need to find the system that works best for you. But let's cover the basic structure that can help us get organized and prioritize our tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Making a List\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to **(1) make a list of all of the tasks that need to get done.** You can make this list on a piece of paper, a text file in your computer, a bug tracking system, or a ticket management system. Whatever works for you. The point is to have all the tasks listed in one place to avoid depending on your not always perfect memory later. Once you have the list, **(2) you can check the real urgency of the tasks.** Ask yourself, if any items don't get done today will something bad happen? If yes, then those should be worked on first. Once you're done with the most critically urgent tasks, **(3) you can look at the rest of the list and assess the importance of each issue.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when it looks like everything is important, you should be able to tell that some things are more important than others. For example, a task that will benefit more people is more important than a task that will benefit less people. If there are a bunch of different tasks that depend on you completing one, that roadblock is more important to clear than the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it still seems like everything is on fire, you can try dividing the tasks into groups of \n",
    "\n",
    "- most important \n",
    "- important\n",
    "- not so important\n",
    "\n",
    "And then sort the tasks inside each group, but don't spend too much time doing this sorting. In the end, the exact order isn't what matters. What matters is that you spend most of your time working on the most important tasks. And if you work with a team of people, it's a good idea to share both the list of tasks and the standard of prioritization among team members. This helps you avoid having to do the work multiple times and coming out with different priorities. Once you have a list of the most important tasks to work on, **(4) you'll want to have a rough idea of how much effort they'll take.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Delegating Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk more about estimating times in the next video. This isn't about exact timing, it's about assigning rough sizes. One common technique is to use small, medium, and large. And when the range of sizes is big enough, include extra small or extra large if needed. Once you identify the most important tasks and how big they are, you can start working on them. If possible, try to start with the larger, most important tasks to get those out of the way first. But as we called out, when our work involves IT support, we know that we'll have to deal with interruptions. And working on complex tasks while getting interrupted can be very frustrating. I hear that. \n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy that can help us with that is saving the most complex tasks for the moments when we're less likely to get interrupted. If you know that you get busiest in the morning, and you tend to have more quiet time during the afternoon, it makes sense to work on easy and quick tasks early in the day. Save the most complex tasks for later, when you'll have more time to concentrate on them. But when your focused time starts, you should make sure that you work on those large complex tasks and not on the easy ones. Otherwise, the complex tasks will never get done. **The key here is to always work on important tasks.** If a task is not important, it shouldn't be done at all. Really, we live by this rule here at Google. Then select which task you're going to deal with depending on urgency and how much time you can devote to it, starting with the biggest tasks that you can fit in the time you have available. \n",
    "\n",
    "But keep in mind, this shouldn't stop you from taking a break or working on experimental projects. Taking breaks is important because it allows our creative minds to stay fresh, and working on a fun side project can help us research emerging technologies and come up with new ideas. Did you know that this very certificate program got its start as a side project at Google? \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, but what if the unthinkable happens? What can we do if after all of this prioritizing, sizing, and ordering there's just too much work to be done and too few hours in the day? The first thing to know is this is normal, most people working in IT have too much to do and can't get all the things they want done. Unfortunately, us humans can't multiply ourselves on command yet and working extra hours is not sustainable long-term. Which means there are basically two options, either you get extra help from other team members or you decide that some tasks weren't really that important, and they won't get done. For both of these options, you'll need to involve other people, like your manager, and make sure that expectations get clearly communicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks, like fixing the permissions in a directory, changing a faulty keyboard, or installing a new application on a single computer, can be self-contained and completed in a small amount of time. Other tasks, like upgrading the database software to a new version, automating the creation of user accounts, or writing a wrapper to adapt to incompatible programs, are larger projects that can take several days or maybe even weeks to complete. When that's the case, it's important to have a rough estimate of how long the tasks will take to be completed and to clearly communicate expectations to those affected. We'll cover these two aspects in the next couple of videos."

    "## 3. Estimating the Time Tasks Will Take\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've called that before, when deciding whether a manual task needs to be automated, we should consider two things; how many times we'll do the task over a period of time and how long it takes to do it manually. From there, we can figure out if that number is larger than the time it will take us to write the automation. This sounds great in theory, but the problem is that we don't know how long it'll take us to write the automation until we've actually written it. \n",
    "\n",
    "All we can do is estimate it, and most of us are really bad at estimating how long tasks will take. We tend to be too optimistic about the amount of time that a certain piece of code will take us to write or a certain infrastructure will take us to set up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, our first instinct is to consider how much we can get done with an ideal amount of focus on the work and a full grasp of the problem we're trying to solve. We forget to take into account the many obstacles that we might face like finding a bug that we don't know how to fix, being interrupted by a problem that needs more urgent attention, or discovering that a new tool doesn't work well with the rest of the tools we have in place. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're trying to estimate how long it will take you to complete a project, big or small, you need to be realistic. Avoid being overly optimistic with your time estimates. The best way to do this is to compare the task that you're trying to do with similar tasks that you've done before. This way, you're not estimating based on how long you would like the project to take but on how long other similar projects actually took in the past. If the task at hand is large, it might be hard to find something similar enough to use for comparison. So to make a better estimate of a bigger than average project, you'll want to chop it up. Split the task into smaller steps. Compare each step to a similar task that you've done in the past and assign an estimated amount of time to each step based on that. \n",
    "\n",
    "If one smaller step is still too large, then split it into even smaller pieces until you can compare each piece of the puzzle was something that you've done before. Once you've got all those estimated times, just add them up and you'll have a rough estimate of how long the whole task will take. \n",
    "\n",
    "But even that's going to be optimistic since putting all the pieces together will take additional time. So once you have a rough estimate of the total time of all the steps, you want to factor in some extra time for integration. This should also come from prior experience. Think about how long it took you to integrate the pieces of a project before, and you'll have a rough idea of how much to add to the previous value. Time really flies huh? \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how optimistic we humans are, even after basing those estimations on previous experience, the number you come up with is going to be very close to the best possible scenario. Even if you're prepared for something to go wrong, it's impossible to anticipate new unknown bumps in the road, so take this estimation and multiply it by a factor. Once again, this factor works best when it's based on previous experience. So if the last time you did this exercise, it took you three times longer to complete the task than you'd planned, go ahead and multiply your estimation by three. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like we're inflating the numbers, but remember, you want to have a grounded estimate of how long it will take you to complete the task. That means taking into account the obstacles that you'll certainly run into but haven't come across yet. No matter how detailed we are, the final estimation won't ever exactly match the time it takes, but it will give us a rough idea of whether we can complete the task in a few hours, days, weeks, or months. Once you've made your estimation, you want to note it down somewhere so that you can check later to see how close you were to the original number. You can adjust future estimations based on that. You will also want to communicate with those affected and let them know when they can expect the task to be done. We'll talk more about that in our next video."

    "## 4. Communicating Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're dealing with an issue that's affecting one or more users, you might feel rushed to meet expectations, SAP or the people you're helping. Everyone's got their own ideas of how long it will take you to solve the problem and when they can expect a solution. They might be wondering, what's the holdup? If the issue is that the users spilled coffee on their keyboard and needs a new one, the expectation is that replacing the keyboard will be a very small task that will take almost no time. If the issue is that there's a new employee starting soon and they need a new computer setup for them, the expectation is that it will take much longer than replacing a keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we have an automated process for setting up new computers, which means there's very little manual work, to have successful interactions with our users, it's important to understand these implicit expectations and let users know if fixing the problem will take longer than they expect. Users will be happy if the issue is resolved within their expectations, but will become frustrated if it takes much longer than they thought. But as long as we communicate with them early about the circumstances, they will be able to understand this and manage their time accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have to replace a keyboard but you have no spares available. This means, you'll need to buy a new one or maybe even a whole batch to have a spare available next time. It's important to communicate upfront to the user that in this case, the replacements will take more time and then figure out how critical getting the replacement is. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the user is an accountant, working on the salary deposit order, which needs to be sent to the bank in one hour or nobody gets their payment on time, you might opt for giving them your keyboard while you go and buy another one at the closest hardware store. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, if the user can work on their laptop until the next day when a new batch of keyboards is scheduled to arrive, you don't need to go out of your way to get early replacement. It's also important to let users know if there are any conflicting priorities that might delay the response to whatever they need. Say a user calls you to request access to a shared resource, but you're in the middle of dealing with an issue that's causing the company's database to be offline. Even if the user request is quick and easy to solve, fixing the database is critical and affects the whole company, so it should take priority. In this case, make sure you tell the user that you're dealing with a crisis and that you'll help with their request once the crisis is resolved, give them an idea of when they can expect their issue to be fixed so they can plan what to do next. \n",
    "\n",
    "So as a general rule, communication is key. **Try to be clear and upfront about when you expect the issue will be resolved, and if for any reason the issue isn't solved by then, explain why and what the new expectation should be.** Unfortunately, when the issue you're trying to solve involves troubleshooting and debugging, it's usually very hard to give an accurate estimate of how long it will take you to fix the problem. Notice a theme, estimating the time it takes to perform more complicated work is tough. A lot of your time will be spent investigating looking into what's going on and figuring out what should be happening. In that case, make sure to let users know when they can expect an update on their issue and give them timely updates. \n",
    "\n",
    "If possible it's a really good idea to have users filed the requests through a **ticket tracking system.** Using a system like this has a ton of advantages. Having all the work you need to do in one place lets you organize your tasks by priority as we discussed before. Receiving reports of issues through a system instead of a phone or chat, lets you make better use of your time. You can now decide when you'll look at the list of issues instead of getting interrupted in the middle of a task, and when you have an update for an issue that you've been working on, you can easily update the ticket with news without having to track down users to let them know what's up with their request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, try out some practical shortcuts when dealing with users. It makes sense to take some time to think about the work you do and figure out ways to avoid interruptions and save time. For example, if a user tells you that their mouse doesn't work, your first instinct might be to go check it yourself and then bring a new one if necessary, but that's a lot of back and forth, instead you could ask the user to bring the faulty mouse to you so that you can test it at your computer and if it's broken change it with a new one or even better, if you trust your users, you might even leave a set of mice, keyboards, and other accessories available for users to take when the one they're using breaks down. That's what we do here at Google and it saves us a ton of time and frustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the same lines, if your company's budget allows, you could have a couple of spare computers ready to be used. That way, when a computer breaks down, you can get the user back to work as quickly as possible, then you can debug the faulty computer at your own pace. But not every issue can be solved by having spare devices. Sometimes spending time on improving your infrastructure can help you get more done in less time. Automating processes like installing new computers, setting up new user accounts, deploying virtual machines, or rolling back changes to previous versions can help save you a lot of time when you're responding to an incident. Up next is a reading, including links with more information on how to make the best use of your time, followed by a practice quiz to check that all of this made sense. Should be an easy one, considering how fast you're chugging through this module."
