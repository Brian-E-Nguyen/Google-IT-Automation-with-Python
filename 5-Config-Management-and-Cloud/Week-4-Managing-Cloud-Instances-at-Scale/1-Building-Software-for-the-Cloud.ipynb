    "## 1. Intro to Module 4: Managing Cloud Instances at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back. And guess what? This is the last module in the course. Congratulations on making it here. It's sure been an exciting ride and it's about to get even more interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've learned in the past modules Cloud providers offer us a bunch of different services. By now we've learned a lot about different hosting models. If you're working for a small company you might get by with pre-packaged applications offered in the software as a service model. But as the organization grows so to do the IT needs. Eventually, your company might grow so large you need to start developing your own applications based on the platforms and infrastructure models from Cloud providers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why might you develop your own application? Well developing your own apps gives your IT team more control and flexibility over what the applications do but it also brings a new set of challenges. You'll need to figure out how the different pieces fit together, make sure that the services run reliably and troubleshoot problems when they come up. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few videos, we'll check out some of the options for building software for the Cloud. We'll look into the different types of storage available and how to decide which one to use. We'll also learn more about load balancing and how to distribute a service across many instances. We'll discuss how we can make changes to our systems without breaking everything. And we'll check out some of the limitations that you might run into when running software in the Cloud. We'll wrap up with some best practices for running reliable services. This includes measuring how your service is doing by using a monitoring system and also setting up alerts so you're automatically notified if things don't go as planned. Sometimes systems fail and that's okay. Using the tips you'll learn in this module you'll be prepared to deal with failure and troubleshoot issues when using Cloud services. Once we're done you'll get the chance to debug and fix a problem with an application running in the Cloud. Exciting stuff, right? There's a lot more ground to cover so let's dive in."
