    "## 1. Spinning up VMs in the Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been talking a lot about how the Cloud works, what the different concepts that play are, and what they mean. In the next few videos, we'll be showing you how some common actions that you might perform on the Cloud look in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've called out, there's a bunch of different Cloud providers that you can use for your projects, each with some specific advantages depending on what you're trying to achieve. And while some terms used by one provider might not exactly match the ones used by other providers, the concepts are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these videos, we'll use the Google Cloud platform to demonstrate our examples because, well, it's the platform we know best. All Cloud providers give you a console that lets you manage the services that you're using. This console includes pointers to a lot of different services that the providers offer. Seeing all of the options available, it can be a little dizzying at first. So it's a good idea to start just by familiarizing yourself with the platform before you try to do something with it. This can mean, for example, looking at the available menus and options, and figuring out where the sections that let you use infrastructure-as-a-service are located. No matter the exact menu entries, when you want to create a VM running in the Cloud, there are a bunch of parameters that you need to set. These parameters are used by the Cloud infrastructure to spin up the machine with the settings that we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Process of Creating VM's\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Name\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by choosing the name assigned to the instance. This name will later let you identify the instance if you want to connect to it, modify it, or even delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also have to choose the region and zone where the instance is running. As we called out in an earlier video, you'll generally want to choose a region that's close to your users so that you provide better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Machine Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important option that you'll need to select is the machine type for your VM. Cloud providers allow users to configure the characteristics of their virtual machines to fit their needs. This means selecting how many processing units, or virtual CPUs, and how much memory the virtual machine will be allocated. You might be tempted to select the most powerful VM available, but of course the more powerful the VM, the more money it will cost to run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a sysadmin, you may need to decide between costs and processing power to fit the needs of your organization. When setting up instances like these, it's a good idea to start small and scale as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.4 Boot Disk\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the CPU and memory available, you'll also need to select the boot disk that the VM will use. Each virtual machine running in the Cloud has an associated disk that contains the operating system it runs and some extra disk space. When you create the VM, you select both how much space you want to allocate for the virtual disk and what operating system you want the machine to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Process of Installing VM's\n",
    "\n",
    "To create these resources, we can use the web interface or the command line interface. The web UI can be very useful for quickly inspecting the parameters that we need to set. The UI will let us compare the different options available and even show us an estimation of how much money our selected VM would cost per month. This is great for experimenting, but it doesn't scale well if we need to quickly create a bunch of machines or if we want to automate the creation. In those cases, we'll use the command line interface, which lets us specify what we want once, and then use the same parameters many times. Using the command line interface lets us create, modify, and even delete virtual machines from our scripts. This is a great step towards automation, but it doesn't stop there. We can also automate the preparation of the contents of those virtual machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine spending an afternoon installing and configuring your new web server. You can do this on one machine, and the process is fairly straightforward. You install any necessary software, you modify any configuration settings, and then make sure that it's working correctly. But it would be hard to reproduce this exactly on another machine, and impossible to do it on thousands of machines. This is where reference images and templating come into play. **Reference images** *store the contents of a machine in a reusable format,* while **templating** *is the process of capturing all of the system configuration to let us create VMS in a repeatable way.* That exact format of the reference image will depend on the vendor. But often, the result is a file called a disk image. **A disk image** *is a snapshot of a virtual machine's disk at a given point in time.* Good templating software lets you copy an entire virtual machine and use that copy to generate new ones. Depending on the software, the disk image might not be an exact copy of the original machine because some machine data changes, like the hostname and IP address. But it will have the data that we need to make it reusable on lots of virtual machines. This can be super helpful if we want to build a cluster of 10,000 machines which all have identical software. Up next, we'll do a few demos of this process. We'll show you how we can create new VMs in Google Cloud Console, how we can customize those VMs, and how we can use templating and reference images to automate the creation."

    "## 2. Creating a New VM Using the GCP Web UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's get started with creating a virtual machine on our GCP project. We'll kick things off by navigating to console.cloud.google.com, which is where you'll find the cloud console for GCP. Here, the first step is to create a project so that our VMs are associated to that project. We need to give our project a name, let's name it First Cloud Steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a project, our dashboard has a lot more info. Next, we want to go to the menu entry that lets us create virtual machines. To do that, we'll go into the Compute Engine menu, and select the VM instances entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img9](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-3-Automation-in-the-Cloud/img/img9.jpg?raw=true)\n",

    "\n",
    "Now it's time to select the region and zone. If we click on the region drop-down, we can see all the regions that are currently available to create new VMs. If we click on the zone drop-down we can see the zones available in that region for new VMs. For this example, we'll just keep the default regions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But as we called out, if you're deploying a service, you should select something that's close to your users. Next, we need to select the type of machine that we want to use. We can select between general purpose and memory optimized. And among each of those families, we can select a bunch of different machine types. We can select how much CPU and how much memory we want our VM to have. The right selection will depend on what we plan to do with the computer. For our example, we'll just keep the default machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img12](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-3-Automation-in-the-Cloud/img/img12.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the VM, we need to select the disk that we want to use. The default disk is 10 gigabytes in size and comes with a Debian image on it. We can select a different size or different OS by clicking on the Change button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img13](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-3-Automation-in-the-Cloud/img/img13.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a long list of available operating systems to choose from. The right option will depend on what you're trying to do with your instance. For this example, we'll choose one of the Ubuntu versions. We can select which type of disk we want to use, either the standard disk which is cheaper, or the SSD version which is faster. And we could also change the size if we needed extra storage for our server. For now, we'll just keep the default values here.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the boot disk, we're shown options to determine how access to the machine will work. This can be very simple or very complex, depending on the rest of your project. The default access option allows you to access the instance remotely using SSH, so we'll go with that one for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, the creation wizard lets us pre-configure some firewall rules. Selecting one of these two options would let HTTP or HTTPS traffic reach our machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img14](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-3-Automation-in-the-Cloud/img/img14.jpg?raw=true)\n",

    "And finally, the creation wizard lets us pre-configure some firewall rules. Selecting one of these two options would let HTTP or HTTPS traffic reach our machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot more options we can set, which are tucked away under this link. We won't look into those now, since the defaults make sense for our test machine. But you can check them out on your own to see what other parameters you can set. We're basically ready to create our VM, but before we do that, let's click on the command line link. This will show us how we would create the same VM through the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img15](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-3-Automation-in-the-Cloud/img/img15.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, that's a long command line, but don't worry, you don't need to understand all of those parameters. The takeaway here is that you could select all the options that you want to create the VM that you need, and then copy this command to create a bunch of VMs that are all exactly the same as the one you selected. For now, we'll close this window and then create the VM using the Create button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our instance is being created, this takes a bit of time. The system is assigning the necessary resources to our machine, deploying the operating system image, connecting the network interfaces, and so on. Once it's done setting up, we can connect to it using SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it takes a little while for the system to set up the keys that we'll use to log on. But once it's done, we can use the machine remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check that the machine we created is using the OS we selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, we've just created a VM using the web interface and connected to it using SSH, how cool is that? Once you're logged into the machine, you can treat it like any normal Linux machine, which is pretty awesome. For example, we can get a text version of the weather in our current location by calling the curl command, which we can use to access web pages from the command line, and passing in wttr.in as the website."
