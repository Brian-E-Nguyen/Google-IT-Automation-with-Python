    "# Interacting With the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll broaden our exposure to what the Linux operating system has to offer. Will do a rundown of the most common Linux commands and we'll see how we can connect the input and output streams to files or even to other programs. We'll also deep our toes into scripting in a different programming language called **Bash**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why are we learning a new programming language when I'm just getting comfortable with Python? Well, don't bash your head against the wall just yet. Being able to script and bash can be really useful complement to our Python scripts. Don't worry, it's going to be a bash. I'll stop the Bash bunch for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, imagine that you wanted to convert all image files in one directory from PNG to JPEG format. There's a command called `convert` that you can use to do this. You could definitely do this in Python, by going through all the files in the directory using `os.listdir` and can convert using subprocess.run. But it would end up being a really complex script for something that's actually super simple. You'll soon see how you can do this in Bash with just three lines of code, making it more readable and a lot easier to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my job, I have to write scripts in Bash all the time. I generally opt for Bash when I need to automate just a few lines of code and using Python, wouldn't add any additional value. For example, I had to write a short Bash script recently that mounted several disks one-by-one and compressed and archived the data on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next several videos, we'll look at the syntax needed to do some basic operations in Bash like conditionals or loops. You'll see how it's comparable to Python syntax, but not exactly the same. Still, it's similar enough that it'll be much easier to understand, now that you already know how to program in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you should feel much more comfortable interacting with many system commands available on Linux and creating your own scripts in Bash and knowing when to choose Python or Bash for your scripts. Remember, if your palms are sweating and you're feeling nervous about the upcoming topics, we're here with you every step of the way. Whenever you get stuck, just go back and re-watch the videos. Practice on your own and engage your fellow learners. The best way to learn is to stick with it."

    "## 1. Basic Linux Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already used a bunch of Linux commands by now. So hopefully these commands aren't too foreign. You may remember that `echo` is a command used to print messages to the screen, `cat` is command for showing contents of files, `ls` is the command to list contents of a directory, `chmod` is a command to change permissions of a file, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we call that before, a lot of these commands come from Unix. Back in the 70s, when designing how these programs should behave, the philosophy was that they should do one thing and do it very well. Which means we have a lot of commands, each for doing specific thing. We'll go through them quickly. But as usual, we'll provide a cheat sheet afterwards that you can use as a reference. You have plenty of time to review these commands and practice on your own. So let's get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new directory, we use the `mkdir` command. To change into that directory, we use the `cd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir mynewdir\n",
    "$ cd mynewdir/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might notice, these commands don't print anything to the screen. This is normal and to be expected. A lot of the commands that we'd use don't print anything when they succeed. They only print something if they fail. To check that the `cd` command succeeded, we can use a command like `pwd` to print the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    ".../2-Python-and-OS/Week-6/mynewdir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. We have a directory which is empty. We can copy files using the `cp` command. For example, we can copy the spider.txt file that we have in the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cp ../spider.txt .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What are all those dots. These are shortcuts that we can use to refer to some special directories. The dot-dot shortcut reverses a parent directory, the previous directory and the absolute path while the dot shortcut reverses the _current directory_. So this command is copying the spider.txt file located in the previous directory to this directory. Does that connect the dots? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create an empty file using the touch command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ touch myfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So by now, we have two files in our directory; the spider.txt file that we copied and the myfile.txt that we created using the touch command. Let's look at the contents of a directory using the `ls -l` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls -l\n",
    "total 0\n",
    "-rw-r--r-- 1 BRIAN 197121 0 Aug  3 10:43 myfile.txt\n",
    "-rw-r--r-- 1 BRIAN 197121 0 Aug  3 10:42 spider.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice. We've now called the `ls` command using the dash l command line argument. Remember, command-line arguments let us change the behavior of commands making them do what we want. Without any arguments, ls would just list the names of the files contained in directory. By passing the dash l, we get a lot of extra information distributed in a bunch of columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pop quiz time. What are these columns? \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "-rw-r--r--\n",
    "-rw-r--r--\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first column indicates the permissions of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "1\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second column is the number of i nodes that point to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "BRIAN 197121\n",
    "BRIAN 197121\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth columns indicate the owner and the group to which the file belongs. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "0 Aug  3 10:43 myfile.txt\n",
    "0 Aug  3 10:42 spider.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the size of the file and date of modification and finally, the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out another ls command line argument. By calling `ls -la`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls -la\n",
    "total 4\n",
    "drwxr-xr-x 1 BRIAN 197121 0 Aug  3 10:43 ./\n",
    "drwxr-xr-x 1 BRIAN 197121 0 Aug  3 10:47 ../\n",

    "-rw-r--r-- 1 BRIAN 197121 0 Aug  3 10:42 spider.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-la` flags shows hidden files which are the ones that start with a dot. In this case, the only ones are the shortcuts that we called out earlier. The dot shortcut, for the current directory, and a dot dot shortcut for the parent directory. The sizes of these directories are related to the amount of files in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rename or move a file, we use the `mv` command. To copy a file, we use the `cp` command, like we mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mv myfile.txt emptyfile.txt\n",
    "$ cp spider.txt yetanotherfile.txt\n",

    "-rw-r--r-- 1 BRIAN 197121 53 Aug  3 10:52 yetanotherfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now renamed myfile.txt to emptyfile.txt and created a new copy of the spider.txt file. Each of these commands use the same format. The first parameter is the old file and the second parameter is a new file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the contents of our directory now. We see that we now have two copies of our file, we've 53 bytes and the empty file is now called emptyfile.txt. \n",
    "\n",
    "To delete these files, we can use a `rm` command. We can either go one-by-one or we delete them all together using the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rm *\n",
    "$ ls -l\n",
    "total 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The star is a placeholder that gets swapped out by the names of all the files in our directory. So our directory is once again empty. Now, let's get rid of it. First, we need to change to the previous directory. We do that using `cd ..`. Again dot-dot is a way we use to identify whatever was the previous directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "../2-Python-and-OS/Week-6/mynewdir\n",
    "$ cd ..\n",
    "../2-Python-and-OS/Week-6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All right. Now we can delete the directory using `rmdir`. This command only works on *empty directories* so I wouldn't work if we had left any files in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rmdir mynewdir/\n",
    "$ ls mynewdir/\n",
    "ls: cannot access 'mynewdir/': No such file or directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, when calling the `ls` command, we pass the name of the directory that we want to list and got back an error because the directory didn't exist anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway that was a quick overview of some of the commands we have in Linux to operate with files and directories. There are tons of other commands to talk about. But not enough time to talk about them all. We'll mention some of them in the next few videos and put more info about them in cheat sheet. Makes sure to investigate and practice using all on your own. Remember that reading the documentation, for any given system command, can help you learn more about what it does. On Unix-based systems, this documentation can usually be found in manual or man pages using the man command. Let's keep moving. Up next, we'll talk about a different aspect of the command line interaction. How to redirect IO streams. See you there."
