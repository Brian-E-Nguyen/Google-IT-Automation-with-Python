    "In this module, we'll broaden our exposure to what the Linux operating system has to offer. Will do a rundown of the most common Linux commands and we'll see how we can connect the input and output streams to files or even to other programs. We'll also deep our toes into scripting in a different programming language called **Bash**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why are we learning a new programming language when I'm just getting comfortable with Python? Well, don't bash your head against the wall just yet. Being able to script and bash can be really useful complement to our Python scripts. Don't worry, it's going to be a bash. I'll stop the Bash bunch for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, imagine that you wanted to convert all image files in one directory from PNG to JPEG format. There's a command called `convert` that you can use to do this. You could definitely do this in Python, by going through all the files in the directory using `os.listdir` and can convert using subprocess.run. But it would end up being a really complex script for something that's actually super simple. You'll soon see how you can do this in Bash with just three lines of code, making it more readable and a lot easier to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my job, I have to write scripts in Bash all the time. I generally opt for Bash when I need to automate just a few lines of code and using Python, wouldn't add any additional value. For example, I had to write a short Bash script recently that mounted several disks one-by-one and compressed and archived the data on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next several videos, we'll look at the syntax needed to do some basic operations in Bash like conditionals or loops. You'll see how it's comparable to Python syntax, but not exactly the same. Still, it's similar enough that it'll be much easier to understand, now that you already know how to program in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you should feel much more comfortable interacting with many system commands available on Linux and creating your own scripts in Bash and knowing when to choose Python or Bash for your scripts. Remember, if your palms are sweating and you're feeling nervous about the upcoming topics, we're here with you every step of the way. Whenever you get stuck, just go back and re-watch the videos. Practice on your own and engage your fellow learners. The best way to learn is to stick with it."

    "## 1. Basic Linux Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already used a bunch of Linux commands by now. So hopefully these commands aren't too foreign. You may remember that `echo` is a command used to print messages to the screen, `cat` is command for showing contents of files, `ls` is the command to list contents of a directory, `chmod` is a command to change permissions of a file, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we call that before, a lot of these commands come from Unix. Back in the 70s, when designing how these programs should behave, the philosophy was that they should do one thing and do it very well. Which means we have a lot of commands, each for doing specific thing. We'll go through them quickly. But as usual, we'll provide a cheat sheet afterwards that you can use as a reference. You have plenty of time to review these commands and practice on your own. So let's get started. \n",

Makes sure to investigate and practice using all on your own. Remember that reading the documentation, for any given system command, can help you learn more about what it does. On Unix-based systems, this documentation can usually be found in manual or man pages using the man command. Let's keep moving.

    "## 2. Redirecting Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we've covered a few basic Linux commands, let's talk more about what we can do with I/O streams and Bash. In an earlier video, we talked about the standard I/O streams. By default, the input is provided by the keyboard at the text terminal and the output and error are shown on the screen. This is the case not only for our Python scripts, but for all system commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change this default using the process called redirection. **Redirection** is a process of sending a stream to a different destination. This process is provided to us by the operating system and can be really useful when you want to store the output of a command in a file, instead of just looking at it on a screen. To redirect the standard output of a program to a file we use the greater than symbol `>`. For example, take the following Python program, which just prints a single line of text using the print function.\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "So we need to be super careful when using this redirection that we're not overwriting a file with valuable contents. If we want to *append* the redirected standard out to a file we can use the double greater than sign `>>` instead of single greater than. Isn't that great?\n",

Once we're done looking at the files, we can quit with Q. But it doesn't have to stop there. It's possible to connect a lot more than just two programs using pipes.

Those contents are then sent to a command called `tr`, which gets its name from the word translate. It takes the characters in the first parameter, in this case, it's a space and then transform them into a character in the second parameter. In this case, it's a newline character. \n",

This output is passed via pipe to the sort command once more, this time, with the `-nr` flag, which sorts results numerically and in reverse order, from most to least hits. The output is finally passed to the head command, which prints the first 10 lines to stdl. \n",

    "That's a lot of process, but when you break it down, it makes lot of sense, right? The point isn't to memorize all these commands, but to know that we can pipe as many commands as we need to do exactly what we want. You can use your Python scripts and pipelines too. Python can read from standard input using the `stdin` file object provided by the `sys`s module. This is a file object like the one we obtained using the open function, and like your local library, this file object is already open for reading. \n",
    "\n",

Now, let's use a script to capitalize a file that we have in our computer called Haiku.txt. Let's see the contents of it using cat.\n",

    "Advance your career,\n",

    "The cat command sends the contents of a Haiku.txt file to standard output, which we redirect to our script using a pipe. Our capitalized script uses the sys stdin file object to iterate through each line of standard input, printing the capitalized version to standard output. It's truly poetic, isn't it? \n",
    "\n",
    "We should also call out that we don't need to use a pipe to get the contents of the Haiku.txt file into standard input of our script. Instead, we use the redirection operator we saw in the last video like this.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a rule, if you just need to get something from standard input into your script, using a redirection is enough. But if you want this to be part of a bigger pipeline of commands, you'll need to combine them with pipes. For example, if we only want to capitalize the lines that match a certain pattern, we could first call grip and then connect it with the pipe to our scripts. With a little practice, creating pipelines is a fast and powerful way to perform lots of system administration tasks. When a system command doesn't exist with the functionality that you need, you can write a Python script to fill in the gap and include it in your pipeline. Understanding how to redirect IO streams can come in handy in many situations and when writing code too. We'll see plenty of more examples of this down the pipe. Get it? Pipe? Okay, sorry. Up next, we'll dive into the different ways we can send signals to the running processes on our computer."

    "## 4. Signalling Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with the operating system, we usually have a bunch of different processes that we use to accomplish what we want. And like any well oiled machine, we generally need these processes to communicate with each other. For example, we might have a program that starts a background process and wants it to terminate after a timeout. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way of communicating this is through the pipelines we learned about in the last video. Another way of communicating is through the use of signals. **Signals** are tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action. Using signals, we can tell a program that we want it to pause or terminate. We can also cause it to reload its configuration, or to close all open files. Knowing how to send these signals lets us interact with processes and have more control over how they behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of different ways that we can send these signals. For example, let's execute the ping command in our terminal.\n",

    "The ping command is now running, sending ICMP packets to machine over the network once per second. And it will keep running forever unless we interrupt it. To do that, we can use the Ctrl-C combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "See how, when we interrupt it, the program doesn't just end abruptly. First it prints a summary of what it did and what the results were. It's very polite under these circumstances. What's happening behind the scenes is the process received a signal indicating that we wanted it to stop. When that signal's received, the process does whatever it needs to finish cleanly. The signal that control see sense is called `SIGINT`. It's just one of many signals that we can send. Another keyboard combination that we can use to send a signal is Ctrl-Z. Let's try this one out.\n",

To find out the PID that we want to send the signal to, we'll use the `ps` command which list the currently running processes. Depending on what options that we pass, it'll show different subsets of processes with different amounts of detail. For this example, we'll call `ps ax`, which lists all the running processes in the current computer. And then we'll use the `grep` command to only keep lines that contain the name of the process that we're looking for. Sound good? Okay, let's try this out. We'll run ping on one terminal, and then find its PID and kill it from a second terminal.\n",

Many long running programs, for example, will reload their configuration from disk if we send them a signal. This way we can let the program know that there's an important change in the configuration and it can get applied without the program having to stop to reread it. \n",

We'll also list other resources that you can use if you want to learn more. As we've said before, you don't need to memorize any of this. You'll get better by using them in our practice exercises and by experimenting on your own. To wrap this up, there'll be a quiz to let you practice your understanding of these concepts. The anticipation is killing me."
