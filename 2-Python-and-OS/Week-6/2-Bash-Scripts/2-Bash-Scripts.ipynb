    "## 1. Creating Bash Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned in earlier videos that bash is the most commonly used shell on Linux. Bash is not only the interpreter that runs our commands, it's also a scripting language. We can use Bash to write simple scripts when we need to use a lot of commands. In the next few videos, we'll learn how to write these scripts and why they're useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example of why you would even want to do this. In your job as an IT specialist, you sometimes need to debug a computer that's not behaving correctly. There are lots of commands that can tell you what's going on in there to help you with your debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `ps` command can list all the current running processes. The `free` command can show you the amount of free memory. The `uptime` command can tell you how long the computer has been on and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you need to debug a computer, you can manually run these commands one by one, followed by as many commands as you can think of that might be helpful. But that already sounds tedious just describing it. What if instead, you can run a single command that can gather all these information in just one shot? Well, I have some good news for you. We can do this by creating a Bash script that contains all of the commands that we want to call, one after the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple version of a script like that. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo 'Starting at $(date)'\n",
    "echo\n",
    "\n",
    "echo 'UPTIME'\n",
    "uptime \n",
    "echo\n",
    "\n",
    "echo 'FREE'\n",
    "free \n",
    "echo\n",
    "\n",
    "echo 'WHO'\n",
    "echo who \n",
    "echo \n",
    "\n",
    "echo 'Finishing at: $(date)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script we're seeing here is calling three main commands, uptime, free, and who, which lists users currently logged into the computer. It uses the `echo` command to print some other information and to make the output a bit more readable by leaving empty lines between the commands. We're also calling the `date` command to print the current date. To call this command, we're using a special notation by putting the command inside dollar sign parentheses. This indicates that the output of the command should be passed to the echo command and be printed to the screen. Now, let's execute our Bash script and see what happens.\n",

    "Yay, our script is working as expected. The starting and finishing times are the same because there are so few operations we're doing that it takes a computer less than a second to complete them. Not too shabby. Once we add more operations to gather other information, it might take a little bit longer. So that's a simple script. We can keep adding more and more commands to it to make our information gathering command get everything that's relevant for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now see that as a script is written right now, there's one command per line. That's a common practice, but it's not the only way. We could also write the commands on the same line using semicolons to separate them. Let's see what that looks like.\n",

    "## 2. Using Variables and Globs\n",
    "\n",
    "Like we said in the earlier video, bash is a fully powered scripting language, not just a way of executing commands one after the other. We can assign variables, new conditional operations, execute loops, defined functions, and so much more. So much that will only get to cover the very basics in these next few videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with variables. Much like Python, bash lets us use variables to store and retrieve values. In an earlier video, we looked at environment variables. These are variables that are set in the environment in which the command is executing. We mentioned that we set these variables using the equals sign. When we want to access the value of a variable in bash, we need to prefix the name of the variable with the dollar sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the predefined environment variables, we can also define our own variables for our scripts. To do that we just assign a value to the name of the variable that we want to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ example=hello\n",
    "$ echo $example\n",
    "hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice, but heads up. **There can be no spaces between the name of the variable and the equal sign, or between the equal sign and the value.** If we try to define a variable and leave a space at one side or the other, the show will complain that it can't find the command with the name that we're assigning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ example = hello\n",
    "No command 'example' found, did you mean:\n",
    " Command 'gexample' from package 'pvm-examples' (universe)\n",
    "example: command not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "My bad, also remember that any variable that you define in your script or in the command line is local to the environment where you define it. If you want commands from that environment to also see the variable you need to export them using the `export` keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's now modify our script to gather info and add a variable to it. We'll use it to make our script look nicer by adding lines in between each of the commands. To do this, we'll define a variable called line, and we'll put a bunch of dashes in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of leaving empty lines, we'll print this variable to separate our commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "line=\"-----------------------------\"\n",
    "echo \"Starting at $(date)\"; echo $line\n",

    "\n",
    "Perfect, there you have it, we set and used a variable in our bash script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on to another interesting feature available in bash called globs. **Globs** are characters that allow us to create list of files. The star `*` and question mark `?` are the most common globs. Besides being extremely fun to say globs, using these globs lets us create sequences of filenames that we can use as parameters to the commands we call an R scripts. You've probably come across them before, but let's do a quick recap of how we can use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In bash, using a star in the command line we'll match all filenames that follow the format that we specify. Let's check out a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo *.py\n",
    "capitalize.py stdout_example.py streams_err.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that when we write star.py, the shell turns it into a list containing all the filenames to end with py in the current directory. We can also use a star with no prefix or suffix which would match all the files in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1-Interacting-With-Shell.ipynb capitalize.py error_file.txt haiku.txt new_file.txt spider.txt stdout_example.py streams_err.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the question mark symbol can be used to match exactly one character instead of any amount of characters, and we can repeat it as many times as we need. For example, we can get the text files with five characters in their name by using the five question marks together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ echo ?????.txt\n",
    "haiku.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using globs like this, lets us create list of files that we might operate on, like calling other commands in passing this list. If you want to use this functionality in Python, it's available through the glob module. That might sound like something in Alien might say, but it's actually pretty powerful. Of course, there's a lot more we can do with bash scripting. Coming up in the next video, we'll talk about conditional execution."
