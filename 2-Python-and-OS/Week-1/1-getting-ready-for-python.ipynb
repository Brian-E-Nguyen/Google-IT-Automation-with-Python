    "## 1. The Operating System\n",
    "\n",
    "he operating system is a software that manages everything that goes on in the computer. It reads, writes, and deletes files from the hard drive. It handles how the processes start, how they interact with each other, and how they eventually finish. It manages how memory gets allocated different processes, how network packets are sent and received, and how each programming can access the different hardware components. Basically, the OS is a total boss and doesn't mess around\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually two main parts in operating system: the kernel and the user space\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources. As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The User Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The User space is basically everything outside of the kernel. These are things that we interact with directly, like the system programs and user interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Operating Systems in General\n",
    "\n",
    "The operating system does a lot of things. It does so much that we need a bunch of courses that cover all of it. But for this course, we'll focus on managing files and processes on the OS running on your computer. The scripts we'll write will all run in the user space. In some cases though, our scripts may interact with the kernel of the operating system to get extra information or to ask it to perform certain operations. As you probably already know, there's a lot of different operating systems out there. The major operating systems using IT today are Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The Windows operating system is developed by Microsoft, and is widely used in the business and consumer space. Most PCs come with Windows as the default operating system. Mac OS is developed by Apple and is mainly used in the consumer space. If you purchase any Apple computer, they'll come with Mac OS preloaded. Linux is an open source operating system. Open source software is free to share, modify, and distribute. Score. Linux is used heavily in business infrastructure. Most servers in the world today are running Linux. It's also available in the consumer space, although less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Linux \n",
    "\n",
    "Linux itself is actually the name of the kernel originally developed by Linus Torvalds, also a total boss. Because of the evolution of the rest of the operating system, we typically use Linux to refer to both the kernel and the whole operating system. Today, Linux has grown into a huge community effort with developers all over the world contributing to its success. Because Linux is open source, a lot of different organizations package their own versions of it, unlike Windows or Mac OS which are solely developed by their respective companies. We refer to these different flavors of Linux as distributions. Some common Linux distributions are; Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've heard of Chrome OS, you may know that it's another operating system based on a Linux kernel. But unlike other distributions, Chrome OS is usually considered an OS in its own right. Lastly, the Android operating system which is used a lot on smartphones also runs a Linux kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard of Unix. Unix is an operating system developed back in the 70's by Bell Labs. After its original release, the OS went through a bunch of different versions with different companies releasing variants of it. The fundamental ideas of how Linux works today are based on the Unix principles. A lot of the tools that we use to interact with the operating system are open source versions of those originally developed for Unix. This is why these tools in operating principles are usually referred to as Unix. So Linus created Linux which is based on Unix.\n",

    "## 2. Getting Your Computer Ready for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Python Version\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if you have Python installed on your computer, type in this command in your terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what's installed on your computer, there's a bunch of different things that can happen. It could say it doesn't recognize the command, which means you don't have Python installed. It could return a version that starts with the number two, which tells us that you have it installed but it's Python 2. Or it could return a version that starts with the number three which means, you guessed it you have Python 3 installed. For this course, we'll be using Python 3. Some of the things we'll cover are the same on Python 2 and Python 3, but some can be pretty different. So make sure you have Python 3 installed. If running `python --version` returns a version starting with two, try running Python 3 --version. Your computer could tell you that the command isn't present which means you'll have to install Python 3, or it can return a version that starts with number three which means you already have Python 3 installed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 What Are Modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "After checking that you have Python 3 installed, we'll also learn about installing additional modules that aren't part of the Python Standard Library. You'll need these additional modules for some specific exercises in the course. What are these additional modules that we are talking about? In the intro to Python course we talked about the Python Standard Library. This comes as part of the Python installation and includes modules for the most common tasks you can do with Python. But there's tons of other things you might want to do in your scripts and not all of them are in the standard library. This is where external modules come into play. We can use external modules for a bunch of tasks, like generating PDFs, starting web pages, creating compressed files, interacting with email, and a lot of other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 How to Get Modules?\n",
    "So how do we find what modules are available? When developers write a Python module that they think others might find useful, they publish it in PyPI, also known as the Python Package Index. We can browse as repository of Python modules to find the module we need. It includes thousands of projects which are classified by different categories, like topic, development studies, and intended audience. These external modules are generally managed with a command line tool called pip. This is a cross-platform tool so you can use it to install, update, and remove external modules on whichever operating system you're running on your computer.\n",
