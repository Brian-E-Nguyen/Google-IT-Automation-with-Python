    "So far we've learned a bunch of new concepts that let us interact with the system. We've learned how to read and write files, how to use regular expressions to process them, how to interact with the system shell, and how to execute commands in that environment. That's really impressive. So take a quick moment to think about how far you've come and about all the new cool stuff you'll be able to do by interacting with the system. \n",

    "Now we're going to take a look at how we can use these tools to help us with our day-to-day work. In the next few videos, we'll dive into a concrete examples centered around processing chunks of data. The kind of data that you might find in a Syslog file or a web request log. The different events that happen in programs that are running in a system and aren't connected to terminal are usually rent log files. Log files contain a lot of useful information, particularly when you're trying to debug a tricky problem that's happening on a computer. On the flip side, sometimes it can be overwhelming to try to find something inside of a log file that contains a whole lot of lines with a whole lot of things in them. So it's a good idea to learn how we can process these files and get our tools to extract information that we want out of them. To do this we'll go back to our knowledge of regular expressions. Using regex's in our scripts gives us a great deal of flexibility when processing log files and other texts data sources too. In a script, we can program any kind of behavior we want, so we can manipulate and process text data and get results we need. We're going to show you how you can do this in the next couple of videos. All right. Let's get started."
