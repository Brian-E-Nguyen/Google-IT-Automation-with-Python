    "Let's quickly review everything you've learned so far in the course. First, you install Python and set up your local environment, then we dove into how to manage files with Python, and finally, we started playing with regular expressions. In this module, we'll check out concepts that help us interact with the running operating system. We'll look at how we can get the most out of the tools available. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll kick this off by talking about how to read user data interactively. Then we'll explore the standard input and output data streams provided by the operating system and see how we can interact with them both from Python programs and from the system programs. In a lot of our examples, we'll interact with the operating system through the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll start familiarizing ourselves a bit more with the Linux shell. We'll also talk about how we can execute system commands from Python. This allows our scripts to harness the power of the rest of the operating system. So it's important that we know how to manipulate the output of these commands and handle any generated errors. We'll wrap up by diving into one important source of information for IT specialist, log files. We already got a peek at a few log files in some of our earlier videos. Now, we'll look at how we can make sense of information these log files provide by using the tools that we've learned throughout the course. So here's a bunch of interesting things ahead of us. Are you excited? Because I'm excited. So what are we waiting for? Let's dive in."

But sometimes we need to interact with the user and ask them for certain pieces of information that just can't be stored in a file. To do this Python provides a function called `input`. This function allows us to prompt the user for a certain value that we can then use for our scripts. Let's see what that looks like."

    "\n",
    "We've now seen a couple ways of getting information into and out of our scripts. We know how to read and write to files and accept input from the keyword and print it to the screen, too. But what exactly is going on behind the scenes when we do this? How does a Python program connect to both the screen and the keyboard? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it uses I/O streams. **I/O streams** are the basic mechanism for performing input and output operations in your programs. You can think of these streams as pathways between your programs and their input sources like a keyboard, or output, like the screen. I/O streams aren't just available for Python programs. When we run a system command on our terminal, I/O streams are also being used to connect that command to the terminal input and output. This way, we can see the results of the command or enter data interactively if that's how the program works. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call these **streams** because the data keeps flowing. A program can read input and generate output as long as it needs to achieve its goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, what do these streams mean in practice? Most operating systems supply three different I/O streams by default each with a different purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard input stream commonly referred to as `STDIN` is a channel between a program and a source of input. Usually in the form of text data from the keyboard. When we use the input function to accept user input in a Python script we're using the STDIN stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard output stream or `STDOUT` is a pathway between a program and a target of output, like a display. `STDOUT` generally takes the form of text displayed in a terminal. As that play when we use the print function to write information to the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last type of pre-made I/O stream is called standard error, or `STDERR`. Standard error displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program. It's usually printed to the screen. If you've ever run some Python code and receive an error, then that error message was probably printed using standard error stream. Let's see this consolidated in an example."

    "## 3. Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we open a terminal application on a Linux computer, whether it's local or a remote machine, the application that reads and executes all commands is called a shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **shell** is a command line interface used to interact with your operating system. The most commonly used shell on Linux is called Bash. Other popular shells are Zsh and Fish, while they operate in similar ways, for this and upcoming videos, when we talk about the Linux shell, we mean Bash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our Python programs get executed inside a shell command-line environment. The variable set in that environment which are called you guessed it environment variables are another source of information that we can use in our scripts. Understanding and being able to change environment variables can be really useful to quickly alter a program's behavior. Usually, we can do this by just making some minor changes in the environment the programs are running in. From a command line prompt, we can check these variables using the `env` or `nth` command. Let's take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ env\n",
    "\n",
    "USERDOMAIN=DESKTOP-7BSD73I\n",

    "...\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "As a refresher, Echo is a command that we use to print texts and Linux shell, and when we want to access the value of the variable in the shell, we need a prefix and name of the variable with a dollar sign. Here, we've printed the contents of the path variable. The shell uses this environment variable to figure out where to look for executable files, and we call them while specifying a directory. All those directories listed there are where the shell will look for programs. For example, when we call the Python 3 program, the shell checks each of the directories listed in the path variable in order, and when it finds a program called Python 3, it executes it. So as we said, we can read the contents of these variables from Python. Let's use a Python script to check that out.\n",

    "print('FRUIT: ' + os.environ.get('FRUIT', ''))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So to access environment variables, we use the Environ dictionary provided by the OS module. In this case, we're using a dictionary method that we haven't used before. The `get` Method is a bit similar to how we've been accessing dictionary values up until now. The difference is what happens when the value isn't present. When we retrieve a value from a dictionary using the key as in OS.environ[fruit] and the key isn't present, we get an error. If we use a `get` Method instead, we can specify what value should be returned if the key isn't present. In other words, the getMethod allows us to specify a default value when the key that we're looking for isn't in the dictionary. So what we're asking Python to do is try to retrieve the value associated with the key, but if the key's not defined return an empty string instead. We're doing this for three different variables; home, shell, and fruit. Let's run the script and see what happens.\n",

    "\n",
    "Up to now. We've seen how different programs can read from and write to standard IO streams and how the show environment can influence execution of a program. Yet another common way of providing information to our programs is through **command line arguments**. These are parameters that are passed to a program when it started. \n",

This lets us create more and more automation and you can't argue with that. \n",

    "The **exit status** is a value returned by a program to the shell. In all Unix-like operating systems, the exit status of the process is zero when the process succeeds and different than zero if it fails. The actual number returned gives additional info on what kind of error the program encountered. Knowing if a command finish successfully or not is helpful information which can be used by a program that's calling a command. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it can use the information to retry the command. If it failed. To check the exit status of a program, we can use a special variable that lets us see what the exit status of the last executed command was. The variable is the question mark variable. So to see the contents we use dollar sign question mark `$?`. \n",
    "\n",

So that's with system commands, but what about Python scripts? When a Python script finishes successfully, it exits with an exit value of zero.

We'll use command line parameters to tell our programs what we want them to do without having to interact with them and we'll use exit values to know if our command succeeded or failed and then log failures and automatically retry the commands if we need to. Well, we've definitely learned a lot over these last few videos. Chances are it got a little tricky at some points but you're doing an awesome job not letting these complex concepts stop you."
