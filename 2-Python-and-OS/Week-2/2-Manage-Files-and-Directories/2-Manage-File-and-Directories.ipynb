    "## 1. Working With Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier videos, we saw how we can read files, iterate through the contents of files, and also write contents of files. Those are the most common operations we'll do with files, but there's plenty of other things we might need to do when working with files in our scripts. We may need to delete, rename or move files, or we might need information about a file, like the time it was last modified or its current size. Let's explore some of the many things that we can do with files in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these operations, we'll be using functions provided by the `OS` module. This module provides a layer of abstraction between Python and the operating system. It allows us to interact with the underlying system without us knowing whether we're working on a Windows, Mac, Linux, or any other operating system supported by Python. This means that you can write and test a script on one operating system like Windows and then run it on a different operating system like Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "But one thing to watch out for, paths can be different across different operating systems. So whenever we're using an absolute path in our code, we need to make sure we can provide alternatives for the platforms we want to support. The OS module lets us do pretty much all the same tasks that we can normally do when working with files from the command line. We can change the file permissions and delete or rename files through our code. This means you can write scripts to do these operations for you automatically. I bet you're already thinking about how useful OS module is going to be in your IT role. \n",

This was adopted years ago to store the times associated to files in computers. Since that's when they started publishing Unix operating systems, Unix uses that date because there couldn't be any file created before that time. While Unix timestamps have a 50-year history, they're still very much present today. They're used by file systems to show when a file was created, accessed, or modified. They are also used in other systems like databases. As an IT specialist, you're bound to run into them in your day to day. \n",

This makes our code more readable and more usable. Then we're iterating through the file names returned by the os.listdir. We know from our previous execution of this function that these are just the names of the files without directory. So using os.path.join, we join the directory to each of those file names and create a String with a valid full name. Finally, we use that full name to call os.path.isdir to check if it's a directory or a file. Maybe you're wondering what's up with that join function? It seems to just add a slash between two strings. Well, the join function let's us be independent from the operating system again. \n",

It's another one of those handy little tools that help us avoid errors when working on different platforms. As we called out earlier, there's a lot of Functions to manage directories in Python and we only covered a handful here. We'll learn some others throughout the course as we need them. This stuff sure is a big complex. Great job sticking with it. Persistence and determination are key qualities for both IT jobs and learning the program and you're showing me that you've got both by the bucket load. The more comfortable you are with what you've learned so far, the easier it'll be to learn new stuff coming up. So take the time now, to review and practice everything before moving on."
