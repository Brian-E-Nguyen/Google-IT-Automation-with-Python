    "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Programming With Files\n",
    "\n",
    "As an IT specialist, it's likely that you'll need to manipulate files and directories on a computer a lot. When you need to work on a large number of files and directories, that's when automation can be a huge help. As a sysadmin, in my job, I interact with files and directories all the time, sometimes even if I have no intention of modifying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might remember, operating systems like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux use file systems to organize and control how data is stored and access. Data is usually stored on a disk and saved in files which are held in containers called directories or folders. File systems are usually organized in a tree structure with directories and files nested under their parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Absolute Path\n",
    "\n",
    "We know where a resource like a directory or a file is located within that tree structure by its path. An absolute path is a full path to the resource in the file system. For example, on a Windows computer, the absolute path to the folder for the user Jordan would be C:\\Users\\Jordan. On a Linux computer, the absolute path to the equivalent directory would be /home/jordan. We call it absolute path because it doesn't matter where in the file system our script is running, the absolute path will always lead us to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Relative Path\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, relative paths use only a portion of a path to show where the resource is located in relation to the current working directory. Relative paths are a shortcut that you can use so you don't have to write out the full file path. But keep in mind, they only makes sense relative to the current location. So for example, if we list the contents of the directory examples, we'll get different outputs depending on what the current directory is.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our current directory is /home/jordan, we'll get the contents of /home/jordan/examples. But if the current directory is /user/share/doc/python3, we'll get the contents of /user/share/doc/python3/examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Opening Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introductory course to Python, we provided information to our scripts by creating variables and passing parameters to our functions with the values that we wanted. This works fine for small scripts, but it's usually not ideal for larger jobs. When processing large chunks of data, it's a good idea to read that data from files. In programming, we work with files all the time. It's such a useful task that most programming languages have the ability to work with files baked into the core set of features. Python is no exception. It gives us file objects which we can use to read and write to files. To open a file on a computer called spider.txt, we can write this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('spider.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're doing here is creating a new file object and assigning it to a variable called File. The parameter we've passed to the open function is the name of the file we want to open. In this case, we're assuming the file we want to read is in the same directory as a script we're running but we can just as easily pass an absolute paths to open a file in a different directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When we open a file, like we're doing in this example, the operating system checks that we have permissions to access that file and then gives our code a file descriptor. This is a token generated by the OS that allows programs to do more operations with the file. In Python, this file descriptor is stored as an attribute of the files object. The file object gives us a bunch of methods that we can use to operate with the file. Now, with this file object, we can read the contents of the file and print them to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've used the `readline` method. It lets us read a single line of a file."

    "This open-use-close pattern is a typical way of working with files in most programming languages. It's a good idea to close files after you've opened them for a few reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, when a file is opening your script, your file system usually lock it down and so no other programs or scripts can use it until you're finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there's a limited number of file descriptors that you can create before your file system runs out of them. Although this number might be high, it's possible to open a lot of files and deplete your file system resources. This can happen if we're opening files in a loop, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, leaving open files hanging around can lead to __race conditions__ which occur when multiple processes try to modify and read from one resource at the same time and can cause all sorts of unexpected behavior. No one wins in a race condition. Now, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm the worst at remembering to close my files, and you might agree with me it could get pretty hard to keep track of what files you've opened and then to remember to close them. Fortunately, the creators of Python agree. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to help us remember to close the file after at the we're done using it, Python lets us create a block of code by using the keyword `with`."

    "\n",
    "When we use a \"with\" block, Python will automatically close the file. So we don't need to remember to do that ourselves. One last thing to think about, thanks Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the open-use-close approach and the \"with\" approach have their advantages. Using a \"with\" block is a good way to open and work on a single file then have the file automatically closed at the end of the block. On the flip side, using open outside of a block means we can use a file object in other places in our code. So we're not restricted to just one single block. But when taking this approach, we need to remember to close it when we're finished"

So when Python reads the file line by line, the line variable will always have a new line character at the end. In other words, the newline character is not removed when calling read line. When we ask Python to print the line, the print function adds another new line character, creating an empty line. What can we do to avoid getting the empty lines? We can use a string method, strip to remove all surrounding white space, including tabs and new lines like this."
