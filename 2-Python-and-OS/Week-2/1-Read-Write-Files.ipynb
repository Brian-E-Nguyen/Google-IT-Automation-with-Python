    "## 1. Programming With Files\n",
    "\n",
    "As an IT specialist, it's likely that you'll need to manipulate files and directories on a computer a lot. When you need to work on a large number of files and directories, that's when automation can be a huge help. As a sysadmin, in my job, I interact with files and directories all the time, sometimes even if I have no intention of modifying them.\n",

    "### 1.1 Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might remember, operating systems like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux use file systems to organize and control how data is stored and access. Data is usually stored on a disk and saved in files which are held in containers called directories or folders. File systems are usually organized in a tree structure with directories and files nested under their parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Absolute Path\n",
    "\n",
    "We know where a resource like a directory or a file is located within that tree structure by its path. An absolute path is a full path to the resource in the file system. For example, on a Windows computer, the absolute path to the folder for the user Jordan would be C:\\Users\\Jordan. On a Linux computer, the absolute path to the equivalent directory would be /home/jordan. We call it absolute path because it doesn't matter where in the file system our script is running, the absolute path will always lead us to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Relative Path\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, relative paths use only a portion of a path to show where the resource is located in relation to the current working directory. Relative paths are a shortcut that you can use so you don't have to write out the full file path. But keep in mind, they only makes sense relative to the current location. So for example, if we list the contents of the directory examples, we'll get different outputs depending on what the current directory is.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our current directory is /home/jordan, we'll get the contents of /home/jordan/examples. But if the current directory is /user/share/doc/python3, we'll get the contents of /user/share/doc/python3/examples."
