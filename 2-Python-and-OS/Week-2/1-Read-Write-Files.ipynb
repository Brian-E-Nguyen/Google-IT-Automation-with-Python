    "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Programming With Files\n",
    "\n",
    "As an IT specialist, it's likely that you'll need to manipulate files and directories on a computer a lot. When you need to work on a large number of files and directories, that's when automation can be a huge help. As a sysadmin, in my job, I interact with files and directories all the time, sometimes even if I have no intention of modifying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might remember, operating systems like Mac OS, Windows, and Linux use file systems to organize and control how data is stored and access. Data is usually stored on a disk and saved in files which are held in containers called directories or folders. File systems are usually organized in a tree structure with directories and files nested under their parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Absolute Path\n",
    "\n",
    "We know where a resource like a directory or a file is located within that tree structure by its path. An absolute path is a full path to the resource in the file system. For example, on a Windows computer, the absolute path to the folder for the user Jordan would be C:\\Users\\Jordan. On a Linux computer, the absolute path to the equivalent directory would be /home/jordan. We call it absolute path because it doesn't matter where in the file system our script is running, the absolute path will always lead us to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Relative Path\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, relative paths use only a portion of a path to show where the resource is located in relation to the current working directory. Relative paths are a shortcut that you can use so you don't have to write out the full file path. But keep in mind, they only makes sense relative to the current location. So for example, if we list the contents of the directory examples, we'll get different outputs depending on what the current directory is.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our current directory is /home/jordan, we'll get the contents of /home/jordan/examples. But if the current directory is /user/share/doc/python3, we'll get the contents of /user/share/doc/python3/examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Opening Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introductory course to Python, we provided information to our scripts by creating variables and passing parameters to our functions with the values that we wanted. This works fine for small scripts, but it's usually not ideal for larger jobs. When processing large chunks of data, it's a good idea to read that data from files. In programming, we work with files all the time. It's such a useful task that most programming languages have the ability to work with files baked into the core set of features. Python is no exception. It gives us file objects which we can use to read and write to files. To open a file on a computer called spider.txt, we can write this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('spider.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're doing here is creating a new file object and assigning it to a variable called File. The parameter we've passed to the open function is the name of the file we want to open. In this case, we're assuming the file we want to read is in the same directory as a script we're running but we can just as easily pass an absolute paths to open a file in a different directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When we open a file, like we're doing in this example, the operating system checks that we have permissions to access that file and then gives our code a file descriptor. This is a token generated by the OS that allows programs to do more operations with the file. In Python, this file descriptor is stored as an attribute of the files object. The file object gives us a bunch of methods that we can use to operate with the file. Now, with this file object, we can read the contents of the file and print them to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've used the `readline` method. It lets us read a single line of a file."

    "\n",
    "Second, there's a limited number of file descriptors that you can create before your file system runs out of them. Although this number might be high, it's possible to open a lot of files and deplete your file system resources. This can happen if we're opening files in a loop, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, leaving open files hanging around can lead to __race conditions__ which occur when multiple processes try to modify and read from one resource at the same time and can cause all sorts of unexpected behavior. No one wins in a race condition. Now, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm the worst at remembering to close my files, and you might agree with me it could get pretty hard to keep track of what files you've opened and then to remember to close them. Fortunately, the creators of Python agree. \n",

Using a \"with\" block is a good way to open and work on a single file then have the file automatically closed at the end of the block. On the flip side, using open outside of a block means we can use a file object in other places in our code. So we're not restricted to just one single block.

So when Python reads the file line by line, the line variable will always have a new line character at the end. In other words, the newline character is not removed when calling read line. When we ask Python to print the line, the print function adds another new line character, creating an empty line. What can we do to avoid getting the empty lines?

You might also guess that using the write method on a file object writes contents to it instead of reading from it. The second argument to the open method is new though. So what does the w mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "File objects can be opened in several different modes. A mode is similar to a file permission. It governs what you can do with the file you've just opened. By default, the open function uses the r mode, which stands for read only. You get an error if you try to write to a file opened in read only mode. Since read only is the default, we don't have to pass the R as a second argument when we just want to read the file. Writing however is a whole different story. The w character tells the open function that we want to open the file for writing only. If the file doesn't exist then Python will create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file does exist, then its current contents will be overwritten by whatever we decide to write using our scripts. It's important to remember that when opening a file in write only mode, you can't read its contents. If you try to, the interpreter raises an error. If you want to add content to a file that already exist, you can do that by using other modes like `a` for appending content at the end of an existing file.\n",

    "So remember, double check that you're opening the right file using the right mode. For example, if you're generating a log file of events that your program came across, you probably want to open the file using append, a mode. Opening it in write, w mode, would mean you'd write over any previous entries in that file, and that's not a good idea for a log file. Or if you're generating a report and wants to write it out to a new file using the write, w mode, you probably want to check if the file exists, to avoid losing any previous contents. \n",
