This means that Python interpreter shouldn't try to interpret any special characters, and instead, should just pass the string to the function as is. In this example, there are no special characters. The rawstring and the normal string are exactly the same, but it's a **good idea to always use rawstrings for regular expressions in Python**. We'll be using raw strings in all of our examples.

We have to restrict our wildcards to a range of characters to do this. \n",
