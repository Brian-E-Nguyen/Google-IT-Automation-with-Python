    "We can use a backslash in this way to escape any special characters, including the ones that we haven't even talked about yet. Something to watch out for. It can get really confusing with backslashes since they're also used to define some special string characters. We've called out, for example, that `\\n` is a sequence using Python to indicate a new line, and `\\t` does the same for tabs. __When we see a pattern that includes a backslash, it could be escaping a special regex character or a special string character.__ \n",

    "Using raw strings, like we've been doing, helps avoid some of these possible confusion because the special characters won't be interpreted when generating the string. They will only be interpreted when parsing the regular expression. On top of this, Python also uses the backslash for a few special sequences that we can use to represent predefined sets of characters. For example, `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character including letters, numbers, and underscores. Let's check out a couple of examples."

Another great resource for testing out your regular expressions is a website called `regex101.com`.
