Printing is useful when we want to see if a string matches a certain pattern. But most of the time, we want to take the information that we matched and use it for something else.\n",

We want to turn this around and create a string that starts with the first name followed by the last name. We can do this using a regular expression with capturing groups. Let's see how this works. \n",

It's used for creating new strings by substituting all or part of them for a different string, similar to the replace string method but using regular expressions for both the matching and the replacing. Let's see this in an example. So we had some logs in our system that included e-mail addresses of users and we wanted to anonymize the data by removing all the addresses. We could do that by using an expression."

    "So once again we'd use parentheses to create capturing groups. In the first parameter, we've got an expression that contains the two groups that we want to match: one before the comma and one after the comma. We want to use a second parameter to replace the matching string. We use backslash two to indicate the second captured group followed by a space and backslash one to indicate the first captured group. When referring to captured groups, a backslash followed by a number indicates the corresponding captured group. This is a general notation for regular expressions, and it's used by many tools that support regexes, not just Python. \n",

    "We can also use them to match patterns that repeat themselves which use capturing groups as back references. We won't look into them here, but if you want to learn more, you'll find a bunch more info about them online. With that, we've wrapped up our overview of the power of regular expressions in Python. There were some things that we didn't get to cover, but our aim is to give you a foundation to build on. We hope that you've got a pretty good picture of the many things that we can do with regexes, and we encourage you to keep learning about them on your own. Now as we've said, regular expressions aren't easy, but they're incredibly useful, so well worth the effort to master. To help you do this, we've got a practice quiz up next before you can jump into the next lab.\n",
