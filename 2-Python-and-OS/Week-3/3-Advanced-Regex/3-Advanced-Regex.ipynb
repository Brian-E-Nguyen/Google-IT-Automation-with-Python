    "Up to now, we've used the `search` function to check if a string matched a certain pattern. But the only thing we've done with the result is print. Printing is useful when we want to see if a string matches a certain pattern. But most of the time, we want to take the information that we matched and use it for something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may want to extract the hostname or a process ID from a log line and use that value for another operation. For that we need to use a concept of regular expressions called **capturing groups**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing groups are portions of the pattern that are enclosed in parentheses. Let's say that we have a list of people's full names. These names are stored as last name, comma, first name. We want to turn this around and create a string that starts with the first name followed by the last name. We can do this using a regular expression with capturing groups. Let's see how this works. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll create a matching pattern that matches a group of letters followed by a comma, a space, and then another group of letters. To capture our groups, we'll put each group of letters between parentheses like this."
