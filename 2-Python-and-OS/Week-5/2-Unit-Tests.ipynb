    "As we mentioned, there are lots of different types of test that we can write to perform automatic testing. The most common type is a unit test. **Unit tests** are used to verify that small isolated parts of a program are correct. Unit tests are generally written alongside the code to test the behavior of individual pieces or units like functions or methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests help assure the developer that each piece of code does what it's meant to do. An important characteristic of a unit test is **isolation**. Unit test should only test the unit of code they target, the function or method that's being tested. This ensures that any success or failure of the test is caused by the behavior of the unit in question and doesn't result from some external factor like the network being down or a database server being unresponsive. In other words, when testing a function or method, we want to make sure that we're focusing on checking that the code in that function or method behaves correctly. We don't want our test to fail for external reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a related note, our tests should never modify the production environment. This is a live environment that runs a software that users interact with. When developing test, if for any reason we do need to interact with some other software, we'll normally do that in a **test environment**, where we'll have control over how it behaves. It's our house, our rules. So the goal of the unit test is to verify that small, isolated parts of a program are correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do that? It generally boils down to a simple pattern. Given a known input, does the output of our code match our expectations? Let's take a piece of code similar to what we wrote awhile back to rearrange a name in the format last name comma first name and think about how we test it."

    "The function has produced the output we expected, given the input we provided. So it has pass this particular unit test. Gold star, hang it on a fridge. The test focus on a small isolated piece of the code and validated our assumption about how it worked. Because the scope of the test is restricted to a small specific unit, these types of tests usually run pretty quickly. Debugging them is simple since there are a limited number of reasons for them to fail. Creating unit tests for our code will mean writing a bunch of test cases that verify that when we input some parameters, we get the output that we want. Of course, the whole point is to run these tests automatically so that we don't have to manually do this ourselves each time. Up next, we'll talk about how we can actually write automatic tests in Python. Exciting, right?"

    "We've now looked at the principles behind automatic testing. We know that by having automatic tests, we can run them as many times as necessary to make sure that our code does what we want it to do. So how we do this in Python? We need to write some code that runs a test and verifies the output. This way, we can get our computer to do the work for us. To demonstrate the testing workflow, we'll create unit tests for the rearrange_name function from the previous video.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we touched on earlier, automatic tests are usually written alongside the code that we want to test. What this means in practice is creating a separate Python file with the test. The convention is to call the script with the same name of the module that it's testing and appending the suffix `_test`. So for our rearrange module, we'll create the rearrange_test.py file.\n",

    "```\n",

To access this functionality, we create our own class by inherits from test case, thus inheriting all those testing methods. So we're going to write our own test rearrange class that inherits from test case. Do you remember what the syntax for that was? We need to include the class that we want to inherit from in the parentheses.\n",

    "We called our test class, TestRearrange, and indicated that it should inherit functionality from the TestCase class located in the unit test module. Any methods we define in our TestRearrange class that start with the prefix test will automatically become tests that can be run by the testing framework. So we're ready to write our first test case. What's it going to be? In our last video, we manually tested one simple case. Let's turn that manual test into an automatic test that verifies that basic names are formatted correctly.\n",

    "With this method which we've called `test_basic`, we kick off by setting up our expected inputs and outputs. We then use the assertEqual method provided to us by the test case class we inherited from to verify that what we expected is exactly what we got. The `assertEqual` method basically says both of my arguments are equal. If that statement's true, then the test passes. If it's false, the test fails and an error is printed to the screen when the test is run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we've got our first unit test. So how can we run it? In the main part of our program, we'll call the `unittest.main()` function, which will run the test for us.\n",
