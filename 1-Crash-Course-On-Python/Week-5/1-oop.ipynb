    "Imagine you have to describe an apple to someone who's never seen one before, how would you do it? And what would you say, besides that it's delicious? You might start off by saying that an apple is a type of fruit. You might talk about how there are lots of different kinds of apples, each with its own color, flavor, and name. Well, when you're explaining concepts to your computer, it's a good idea to approach it in a similar way. Your computer has no idea what an apple is, or even what a fruit can be. If you want your computer to understand these things, you have to describe them in your programs and scripts.\n",

    "When we use the type function as we just did here, Python tells us which class the value or variable belongs to. And since this is a class, it has a bunch of attributes and methods associated with it. Let's take the string class for an example. In this case, the only attribute is the content of the string. What about the methods? Well, in earlier videos, we looked at a bunch of methods provided by the string class, like upper() to create an uppercase version of the string. Or isnumeric() which checks whether or not the contents are all numeric. Each string we've used in Python up to now has been a different instance of the string class. They all had the same methods, but the contents were different\n",
