You can think of the fruit class as the parent class, and the apple and grape classes as siblings."

    "With the inheritance technique, we can use the fruit class to store information that applies to all kinds of fruit, and keep apple or grape specific attributes in their own classes. For example, we could have an attribute to track how much of an apple is left after it's partially eaten. Of course, this applies to both attributes and methods. If a class has an attribute or a method defined in it, inheriting classes will have the same attributes and methods defined in them. But we can also get them to behave differently depending on what we change. To explore this, let's go back to our piglet example and change it so that there's a base animal class. "

In a system that handles the employees at your company, you may have a class called employee, which could have the attributes for things like full name of the person, the username used in company systems, the groups the employee belongs to, and so on. The employee class could have methods to do a bunch of things, like check if an employee belongs to a certain group, or create an email address based on the name and username attributes. The system could also have a manager class. A manager is an employee, but has additional information associated with it, like the employees that report to a specific manager."
