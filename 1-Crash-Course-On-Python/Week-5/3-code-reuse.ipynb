For example, we could have an attribute to track how much of an apple is left after it's partially eaten. Of course, this applies to both attributes and methods. If a class has an attribute or a method defined in it, inheriting classes will have the same attributes and methods defined in them. But we can also get them to behave differently depending on what we change. To explore this, let's go back to our piglet example and change it so that there's a base animal class. "

The employee class could have methods to do a bunch of things, like check if an employee belongs to a certain group, or create an email address based on the name and username attributes.

This class has a lot of information on the software, like the name, the version, the size, and more.

In this class, we want to know how many packages there are and what's the total size of all the packages. In this case, the repository isn't a package and the package isn't a repository. Instead, the repository contains packages.
