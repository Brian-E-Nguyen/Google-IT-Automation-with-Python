# Google IT Automation with Python

__Google IT Automation with Python__ is a series of courses offered by Google through Coursera. This repositiory is used to document what I have learned through Python code and Markdown.

__NOTE:__ There are some aspects that are missing, such as sections, quiz answers, etc.
