    "\n",
    "When starting with Git, there are a bunch of concepts that we need to learn to understand how things are organized and how our files are tracked. Over the next few videos, we'll introduce some of the main Git concepts. If any of these seem confusing at first don't panic, we'll dive into all of them as we expand our Git knowledge. Let's start by setting some basic configuration. Remember when we said that a VCS tracks who made which changes, for this to work, we need to tell Git who we are. We can do this by using the `git config` command and then setting the values of user.email and user.name to our email and our name like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git config --global user.email 'me@example.com'\n",
    "$ git config --global user.name 'My name'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the dash dash global flag to state that we want to set this value for all git repositories that we'd use. We could also set different values for different repositories. With that done, there are two ways to start working with a git repository. We can create one from scratch using the git init command or we can use the git clone command to make a copy of a repository that already exists somewhere else. We'll talk about remote repositories later in the course. For now, let's start by creating a new directory and then a git repository inside that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd checks/\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/BRIAN/Documents/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/3-Git-and-Github/Week-1/3-Using-Git/checks/.git/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we run git init we initialize an empty git repository in the current directory. The message that we get mentions a directory called. git. We can check that this directory exist using the ls-la command which lists files that start with a dot. We can also use the ls-l.git command to look inside of it and see the many different things it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a Git directory. You can think of it as a database for your Git project that stores the changes and the change history. We can see it contains a bunch of different files and directories. We won't touch any of these files directly, we'll always interact with them through Git commands. So whenever you clone a repository, this git directory is copied to your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you run git init to create a new repository like we just did, a new git directory is initialized. The area outside the git directory is the working tree. The **working tree** is the current version of your project. You can think of it like a workbench or a sandbox where you perform all the modification you want to your file. This working tree will contain all the files that are currently tracked by Git and any new files that we haven't yet added to the list of track files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now our working tree is empty. Let's change that by copying the disk usage that py file that we saw in an earlier video into our current directory. We now have file and a working tree but it's currently untracked by Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make Git track our file, we'll add it to the project using the `git add` command passing the file that we want as a parameter. With that, we've added our file to the **staging area**. The staging area which is also known as the index is a file maintained by Git that contains all of the information about what files and changes are going to go into your next command. We can use the git status command to get some information about the current working tree and pending changes. Let's check that one out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that our new file is marked to be committed, this means that our change is currently in the staging area. To get it committed into the.git directory, we run the git commit command. Let's try that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "        new file:   disk_usage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run this command, we tell Git that we want to save our changes. It opens a text editor where we can enter a commit message. If you want, you can change the editor used to your preferred editor. In our case, this computer has nano configured as a default editor. The texts that we get tells us that we need to write a commit message and that the change to be committed is the new file that we've added. We'll deep dive into commit messages later. For now, let's enter a simple description of what we did which was to add this one file and then exit the editor saving our commit message and with that we've created our first git commit. Up next, we'll talk more about the life cycle of each track file in a git repository."

    "## 2. Tracking Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last video, we mentioned that any Git project will consist of three sections. The Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The Git directory contains the history of all the files and changes. The working tree contains the current state of the project, including any changes that we've made. And the staging area contains the changes that have been marked to be included in the next commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can still be confusing. So it might be helpful to think about Git as representing your project. Which is the code and associated files and a series of snapshots. Each time you make a commit, Git records a new snapshot of the state of your project at that moment. It's a picture of exactly how all these files looked at a certain moment in time. Combined, these snapshots make up the history of your project, and it's information that gets stored in the Git directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the details of how we track changes to our files. When we operate with Git, our files can be either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are part of the snapshots, while untracked files aren't a part of snapshots yet. This is the usual case for new files. Each track file can be in one of three main states: **modified, staged or committed**. Let's look at what each of these mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Modified\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is in the modified state, it means that we've made changes to it that we haven't committed yet. The changes could be adding, modifying or deleting the contents of the file. Git notices anytime we modify our files. But won't store any changes until we add them to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Staged\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the next step is to stage those changes. When we do this, our modified files become stage files. In other words, the changes to those files are ready to be committed to the project. All files that are staged will be part of the next snapshot we take. And finally, when a file gets committed, the changes made to it are safely stored in a snapshot in the Git directory. This means that typically a file tracked by Git, will first be modified when we change it in any way. Then it becomes staged when we mark those changes for tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Committed\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally it will get committed when we store those changes in the VCS. Let's see this in action in our example Git repo. First, let's check the contents of the current working tree using ls-l. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "        new file:   disk_usage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the current status of our files using the Git status command. When we run Git status, Git tells us a bunch of things, including that we're on the master branch. We'll learn about branches later in the course. For now, notice how it says that there's nothing to commit and that the working tree is clean. Let's modify a file to change that.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",

    "        modified:   disk_usage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we've made the change, let's call Git status again and see the new output Again, Git tells us a lot of things, including giving us some tips for commands that we might want to use. These tips can come in real handy, especially when we're familiarizing ourselves with Git. See how the file we changed is now marked as modified? And that it's currently not staged for commit?\n",

    "        modified:   disk_usage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call Git add, we're telling Git that we want to add the current changes in that file to the list of changes to be committed. This means that our file is currently part of the staging area, and it will be committed once we run the next Git command, Git commit. In this case, instead of opening up an editor, let's pass the commit message using the dash m flag, stating that we added periods at the end of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git commit -m'Added periods'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. The Basic Git Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier videos, we discussed some of the basic concepts involved in working with Git. We saw that each repository will have a Git directory, a working tree, and a staging area. And we called out that files can be in three different states, modified, staged, and committed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review these concepts one more time by looking at the normal workflow when operating with Git on a day to day basis. First, all the files we want to manage with Git must be a part of a Git repository. We initialize a new repository by running the `git init` command in any file system directory. For example, let's use the mkdir command to create a directory called scripts, and then change into it and initialize an empty Git repository init. Our shiny new Git repository can now be used to track changes to files inside of it. \n",
    "```\n",
    "~$ cd scripts/\n",
    "~/scripts$ git init\n",
    "Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/scripts/.git/\n",
    "~/scripts$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But before jumping into that, let's check out our current configuration by using the git config -l command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git config -;\n",
    "\n",
    "user.email=me@example.com\n",
    "user.name=My name\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a bunch of info in there, and we won't cover all of it. For now, pay special attention to the user.email and the user.name lines, which we touched on briefly in an earlier video. This information will appear in public commit logs if you use a shared repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "For privacy reasons, you might want to use different identities when dealing with your private work and when submitting code to public repositories. We'll include more details about changing this information in our next reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, our repo is ready to work, but it's currently empty. Let's create a file in it, we'll start with a basic skeleton for a Python script, which will help us demonstrate the Git workflow. As with any Python script, we'll start with the shebang line. For now, we'll add an empty main function, which we'll fill in later. And at the end, we'll just call this main function."

    "## 4. Anatomy of a Commit Message\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier videos, we saw how we can commit snapshots of changes to the Git repository. Let's now talk a little bit more about what makes a good commit message. Writing a clear informative commit message is important when you use a VCS, future you or other developers or IT specialists who might read the commit message later on will really appreciate the contextual information as they try and figure out some of the parts of the code or configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes a good commit message? It can be helpful to keep your audience in mind when you write commit messages. What would someone reading a message weeks or months from now want to know about the changes you've made? What might be especially important or tricky to understand about them? Is there extra information that might help the reader out, like links to design documents or tickets in your ticketing system? \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to how style guides exist for writing code, your company might have specific rules for you to follow when you write commit messages. Even if they don't, it's good to use a few general guidelines to make sure your commit messages are as clear and useful as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A commit message is generally broken up into a few sections. The first line is a short summary of the commit followed by a blank line. This is followed by a full description of the changes which details why they're necessary and anything that might be especially interesting about them or difficult to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the git commit command, Git will open up a text editor of your choice so you can write your commit message. A good commit message might look something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cat example_commit.txt\n",
    "Provide a good commit example\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this commit is to provide an example of hand-crafted, artisanal commit message. The first line is a short, approximately 50 character summary, followed by an empty line. The subsequent paragraphs are jammed-packed with descriptive information about the change, but each line is kept under 72 characters in length\n",
    "\n",
    "If more info is needed to explain the change, more paragraphs can be added after blank lines with links to issues, tickets, or bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit\n",
    "#...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first line is usually kept to about 50 characters or less. The line contains a short description of what the commit changes are about. After the first line, comes an empty line, and the rest of the text is usually kept under 72 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is intended to provide a detailed explanation of what's going on with the change. It can reference bugs or issues that will be fixed with the change. It can also include links to more information when relevant. The line limits can be annoying but they help in making the commit message be more digestible for the reader. There's a git command used to display these commit messages called `git log`. This command will do any line wrapping for us. Which means that if we don't stick to the recommended line wrapping, long commit messages will run off the edge of the screen and be difficult to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take a look at the lines in the commit message that start with the pound symbol. Just like in Python, this symbol indicates that these lines are comments and won't get included in the commit message. Git shows them to us whenever we're writing a commit message as a reminder of what files were about to commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it can be tempting to just write something short like update, change or fix as the description of our commit messages. Don't do it. It's super frustrating to go back to repositories history and discover that there's not enough context to understand what was changed and why. It takes only a few more seconds to write a better description. This can be invaluable down the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following these guidelines can help make your commit message really useful, and the investment of work now will really pay off later. If you're interested in learning more about git commit style, there are plenty of resources out there to read including the Linux kernel documentation itself along with impassioned opinions from other developers. We'll include links to all of them in the next reading. \n",
    "\n",
