    "# Code Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What are code reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub and other repository hosting services offer tools for doing code reviews on their platform. And while this is called code reviews, we can actually use the same tool and process to do reviews of any text file including configuration and documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing a **code review** means *going through someone else's code, documentation or configuration and checking that it all makes sense and follows the expected patterns*. The goal of a code review is to improve the project by making sure that changes are high quality. It also helps us make sure that the contents are easy to understand. That the style is consistent with the overall project. And that we don't forget any important cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews increased the number of eyes that have checked the code. This increases the code quality and reduces the amount of bugs. It doesn't mean that there'll be no bugs, but at least the most obvious bugs will be caught. Also, this helps spread knowledge since both the code writers and the code reviewers now know what the code is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we work in the same office as our teammates, we can do reviews in person by looking together at the changes and discussing how the contents fit together. But when the person that we're working with is in a different office or time zone We're better off using a code review tool. Code review tools let us comment on someone else's code. These let us leave feedback on how they could make their code better. Common code issues are unclear names that makes the code hard to understand. Forgetting to add a test, or forgetting to handle a specific condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we're writing documentation, our reviewer can help us catch typos and things that aren't totally clear. On platforms like Github, it's common for projects to only requires reviews for people that don't have commit access while the project maintainers can commit directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "But doing code reviews improves the code's overall quality. Today, some open source projects and lots of companies require code reviews for everybody. This isn't because they don't trust them, but because they want the highest quality code. And code reviews are how they get there. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to always remember, code reviews are not about us being good or bad coders, they're about making our code better. And not only that specific review, but in general. By getting feedback, we can keep improving our code techniques. And by reviewing other people's code, we can also learn new and different ways of achieving results. Like everybody else after toiling for hours on a problem and finally solving it, all I want to do is submit my code and be done with it. But this rarely happens. Code reviews usually send me back to the drawing board with small errors and nitpicks\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's a good thing. These code reviews point out things that we might have missed along the way and ensure that our code makes sense to others. One example that springs to mind is back when I was writing a script for an Android bug report parser. After hours of fiddling with the code and writing tests to back up what I did, I finally sent it to her code review and thought I was done. It turns out had a bunch of little style guilders that my reviewer wouldn't let me get away with. More importantly, while fixing this style errors, I noticed I forgotten a major use case in my script that would have stopped my code from working. So I fixed both the style errors and the missing use case and could submit my change with a smile. \n",
    "\n",
    "At Google, we believe deeply in the value of reviewing everything we do. Even the content of these courses have been reviewed by lots of people. These reviews and make sure that the contents makes sense are technically correct with no significant gaps and follow the established guidelines. Shout out to my colleagues for keeping us on our toes and making sure that these videos are top rate. Up next we'll talk about the typical reviewing workflow and how to get the most from the review process."

    "## 2. The Code Review Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last video, we explained what code reviews are and how they can make our code better. Now, we'll check out a typical code review using a reviewing tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we've just finished a bunch of code changes, now, we'll ask a reviewer to look at our code. The reviewer might say that everything is okay and our changes approved, but usually they'll find something that needs improving. So they'll add comments to our changes explaining what needs to be fixed and how. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we get the review comments will address them by fixing our typos, adding any missing tests and so on. After addressing a comment, we can mark it as resolved so that we know it's been taken care of. If there's something that we aren't sure how to do or we think a different approach might be better, we can reply to the comment and ask our reviewer for more information without marking the comment as resolved. Once all comments have been resolved and our viewer is satisfied with the results, they'll approve the change and we'll be able to merge it. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, what are all of these comments that I receive? There's a wide range of things your reviewer might have to say about your code. Sometimes, you might have forgotten to take into account something important and you'll need to do significant work to fix it. Sometimes, your reviewer might point out something small, that's not really critical. And the comment is mostly a suggestion for making the code better. These comments are usually prefixed, saying that it's a **Nit.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever it is, it's important that you take the time to understand what the comment is and what you need to do to address it. For example, if you've written a piece of code and your reviewer asks you to explain why or how the code is doing something, it might be tempting to just answer their question in the comment and mark it as resolved. But this isn't a great idea, because only the reviewer gets to see your answer. Instead, it's better to take this as an opportunity to make the code clearer. For example, you could do this by using better variable names or splitting a large piece of code into smaller functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, you can add comments to the code and documentation to your functions to make sure that the how and why are clearly explained. It's common for code reviews to include several comments about the style of the code. To avoid a lot of back and forth, it's a good idea to refer to a style guide that explains the preferred coding style for the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lots of Python projects, use the PEP8 style guide. If the project you're contributing to doesn't include a style guide, make sure that you ask for one. And in case you need inspiration, we've included links to some common style guides in the next reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of code reviewing systems out there. And while they all follow the same patterns, they don't all work exactly the same way. In some code reviewing tools, you'll need one of the project maintainers to approve your code before it's submitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other tools, you'll just need to get a couple +1s from contributors to the project before you can submit. The goal is to always ensure that your code has been reviewed by people who are familiar with the project, so that it's ready to be submitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of a project you've worked on in the past where code reviews could have been helpful? Maybe you worked as a part of a team and had trouble making sure that everyone agreed on how things should be done. Or maybe you were learning how to use a new tool and you would have benefited from a second pair of eyes on your work. No matter how simple or complex a project is, it can always be improved with good code reviews. Up next, we'll dive into how this code reviewing process works on GitHub."

    "## 3. How to Use Code Reviews in GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now, we've talked about the general process of doing code reviews. This process applies to any platform with code reviewing tools. Now, let's check out how this process looks on GitHub, specifically. Remember, a while back in this module, we created a pull request that added a read me file. Conveniently, our colleague just replied with a few comments. Let's have a look.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our reviewer made three comments about our file. The first one is asking us to add a period at the end of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The last one will require a bit more work since it's asking us to include a couple more examples. Let's fix these. We'll add a period at the end of the second sentence, and then add a second hashtag before the example title, and finally, add a few more examples. To do that, we'll use the star character, which is another feature of the markdown language that lets us easily create bullet points. So we'll add a couple of more lines with the same format, and say that Hopper, Grace M. turns into Grace M. Hopper, and that Voltaire stays as Voltaire.\n",

You might remember that git commit dash dash amend modifies commits. So it's not safe to do with commits that have been pushed to the repo. Using amend is pretty much the same as creating a new commit, and then using an interactive rebase to fix up a change. So, the commit gets replaced by a completely new commit with a completely different commit ID. This means that to push it, we'll need to use the dash F flag again.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cool, we've addressed all the comments. We can leave a message in our conversation to let our reviewer know that we've resolved all the comments and ask them to take another look.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our reviewer can now check out the new changes and approve them if they're satisfied. As with lots of other topics we've covered, making the most out of the code review process will require some practice. It's great to have some tips but in the end we need to learn by experience. So don't be afraid to practice practice practice. Up next, you'll find some resources to learn more about code reviews and a quiz to put this knowledge into action. After that, you can try out doing a code review on GitHub."
