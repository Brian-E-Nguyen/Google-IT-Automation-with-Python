    "## 1. Managing Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few videos, we've looked at how we can collaborate with others using tools provided by platforms like GitHub. These tools can be very helpful but some coordination outside of the platform is always going to be needed. For example, the project you're working on might need up medium or large refactor that will affect multiple lines of code across several files. It's important to give your colleagues the heads up that this refactor is coming. \n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, try to do the refactor while the other developers are working on a different part of the project because this helps avoid large and complicated conflicts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've called on a bunch of times that documenting your work is super important. When working together with a large group of people, documenting what you do and why you do it becomes even more important otherwise you'll spend most of your time answering everybody else questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, say there's a problem with your service while you're on vacation or the person who developed the code is on the other side of the world and currently sleeping. In these situations, the documentation needs to be good enough to help someone else fix the problem. The most basic form of this is writing clear code with good comments and documentation for those functions in the code. On top of that, you'll want to create documentation files to let others know how they can interact with your project like the readme.md file that we created an earlier video. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're a project maintainer, it's important that you are reply promptly to pull requests and don't let them stagnate.** The more time that passes until a pull request gets reviewed, the more likely it is that there's a new commit that causes a conflict when you try to merge in the change. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, if the person contributing the changes of volunteer that's just trying to help, they may lose their motivation to work on the project if you make them wait too long for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to remember when you maintain a project especially if it's an open source project that volunteers are contributing to is that **it's important that you understand any changes you accept.** You never know if the other person is going to stick around to maintain the code after you merge it in so you better make sure you can do that. You should also be careful with which patches you accept or reject. Accepting everything that gets sent your way might make your project grow too much and become unmanageable or it might take into account too many corner cases and cause complicated code that's hard to maintain. On the flip side, if you don't accept any pull requests you'll discourage contributors and miss out on keeping your project active and relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about style guides a few times already. If you're contributing to a project, you want to check out the style guide and make sure you follow it. If you own a project, it makes sense to create a style guide so that others know what you're expecting from them. In our next reading, we'll include links to some of the most common style guides and pointers and how to include a style guide in your own project. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to coordinating who does what and when, a common strategy for active software projects is to use an **issue tracker.** This is a super useful tool and we'll find out more about it in the next video. On top of that, when the project is large enough, it's important to have another way of communicating and coordinating between contributors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, most projects used mailing list and IRC channels for communication. Recently, new forms of communicating have gained popularity like Slack channels or Telegram groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're managing your own project, choose whatever communication medium best fits your needs and those of your contributors. If you're collaborating with a project you don't own, you'll want to find out what channels are being used for collaboration and with that you now have a rough idea of how to collaborate with others across the internet. Up next, we'll talk about two important tools that can help us collaborate better, tracking issues and continuous integration."

    "## 2. Tracking Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding who's going to do what is critical when collaborating with others. With no coordination, two or more people might spend time working on the same part of a project while nobody works on the other critical parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you and your colleagues decided that you'd work on building automation software, for keeping the computers on your network up to date. But then instead of dividing the task into smaller pieces and assigning them to different people, you just randomly started working on some part of the infrastructure. The result would probably be total chaos, with different pieces of software that won't work well together, and lots of gaps that nobody worked on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For small teams, it's usually easy enough to discuss in person who's going to be working on what. But as soon as the group starts growing, talking about responsibilities and what to do next becomes more of a hassle. That's when a tool like an **issue tracker or bug tracker** can help us coordinate our work better. An issue tracker tells us the tasks that need to be done, the state they're in and who's working on them. The system also let's us add comments to the issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "These comments can be super helpful. They can give us more details about the problem, explain a way to solve it, or detail how to test if it's been solved. Issue trackers aren't just useful for people actively working on projects. They also let users report bugs when they come across them, even if they don't know how to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes users come across problems that we never even thought possible. And having them report these issues through a bug tracker can help make our projects better. And the tracker can also help volunteers that want to start contributing to the project. Having a clear visible list of the pending work, lets new contributors figure out how to help and where to jump in. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of different solutions to track bugs or issues. There's a popular bug tracker called **Bugzilla,** which is used by quite a few open source projects. On the flip side, platforms like GitHub have an issue tracker baked in. So, if you're hosting your project there, it can be very handy to track work on your project. Like the problems to solve, the features to add and the use cases to include it, let's check it out.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the list of issues for our health-checks projects. For now, it only has one issue asking us to update our documentation. One of our colleagues suggested that we create a new health check that verifies if there are any critical error messages inside the system logs like current log or syslog. Errors that appear there might help troubleshoot some interesting problems. So, this sounds like a good idea for a new check. Let's create an issue for this feature by clicking on the New issue button. For the title of the issue, we'll say that we want to check for critical errors in system logs. And for the issues description we'll say that the new check should go through var/log/currentlog. And var/log/syslog and check if there are any critical errors that need attention.\n",

    "\n",
    "When writing in issues description, it's a good idea to include all the information that we have about the problem or missing feature and any ideas on how to solve it. And if new information comes up later on, it can be added as additional comments on the same issue. Great, we're now ready to submit the new issue.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Okay, we now have the new list in our list of issues to solve. The issues in the list all have numbers that identify them, as we called out in an earlier video, in GitHub, each issue or pull request in a project has a unique number associated with it. So, if we have a pull request with the ID five, there won't be an issue with ID five. GitHub will automatically reference issues and pull requests and comments when we mention them using the hash tag number format. For example, if we use #2 in a comment, it will automatically reference the issue we just created. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're fixing an issue through a pull request, it's possible to automatically close the issue directly once the code is merged. To do this, you need to include a string like `closes:#4` in your commit message or as a part of the description of your pull request. Once the code gets merged into the main tree, GitHub will automatically close the issue with a message linking it to the new commit. Let's try this out by updating the documentation, like the #1 issue requested.\n",

    "\n",
    "This issue seems easy enough to fix, we need to update the README file to use the new file name and explain a bit more about how our script works. Before we start working on this, let's get the issue assigned to us.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assigning issues to collaborators helps us track who is working on what. By assigning the bug to yourself, you can let others know that you're working on it, so they don't need to. All right, let's update the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# health_checks\n",
    "Scripts that check the health of my computers\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the main script is health_checks.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will print \"Everything ok\" if all checks pass,\n",
    "or the corresponding error message if they fail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we're still using the old name of the name file, all_checks.py, we renamed that file a while back to healthchecks.py. Let's change our README to use a new file name using inverted quotes to show monospace text. Then we'll add that the script will print everything okay, if all checks pass and it will print the corresponding error messages if something fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've updated the documentation, let's save the file and commit this change. This time, we'll call git comit -a so that we can edit the commit message in the text editor. We'll say that we've updated the README to use the new name of our script. And in a longer description, we'll add that we've included more info about how the script works. Finally, we'll wrap up by adding the string closes #1, so that the issue will get automatically closed once this commit is integrated into the main tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Update README to use the new name of the script\n",
    "\n",
    "Also add more information about how this works\n",
    "Closes #1\n",

    "\n",
    "So here's the commit message we created with the associated change. See how the #1 that we included as a part of the commit message is automatically detected as a link to the #1 issue. There's a bunch more to learn about tracking issues, but this should be enough to get you started. Feel free to experiment on your own and try more ways to interact with the system."
