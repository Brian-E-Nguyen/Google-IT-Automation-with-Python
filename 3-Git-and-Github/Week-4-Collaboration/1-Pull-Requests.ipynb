    "## 1. Intro to Module 4: Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past modules, we've learned a whole about how to interact with Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered how to use it both locally and remotely. We've seen how to rollback bad changes, solve conflicts when collaborating with others, and a bunch of other little nifty things. In this module, we'll keep exploring the collaboration tools available in Git. We'll learn about tools that allow us to send changes to projects that we aren't a member of, help us improve the quality of our code, and let us track our work better. Some of these tools will be specific to GitHub, but most of the Git repository hosting services have similar tools. So the concepts will still apply if you decide to use a different platform. In recent years, GitHub has become a super popular platform for collaboration across many projects. It's used heavily for open-source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are projects that allow anyone to use, copy, and modify their code. Having the code published online means that anybody in the world can learn from what the project is doing, and even collaborate on fixes and extra features. It also helps us learn from each other, because we can look at how others have solved the problem that we're tackling. I regularly use GitHub to look up code snippets for things that I'm interested in. Most recently, I looked up examples for a movie theater seat finder because I was working on a similar feature for a personal project of mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to learn a new technology, it's a great idea to practice your skills by contributing to a project that uses that technology. To do that, you'll need to know how to interact with the project. This includes how to send bug fixes, how to make sure that your fixes are applied, and even how to figure out which fixes are needed. In this module, we'll cover that and a lot more. So are you excited? I mean, I'm excited. Let's get started.\n",

    "## 2. A Simple Pull Request on GitHub\n",

    "### 2.1 Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "But what exactly is a fork? **Forking** is a way of creating a copy of the given repository so that it belongs to our user. In other words, our user will be able to push changes to the forked copy, even when we can't push changes to the other repo. When collaborating on projects hosted on GitHub, the typical workflows, first, create a fork of the repo, and then work on that local fork. A forked repo is just like a normal repo, except Github knows which repo it forked from. So we can eventually merge our changes back into the main repo by creating a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pull request** is a commit or series of commits that you send to the owner of the repository so that they incorporate it into their tree. This is a typical way of working on GitHub, because in most projects, only a few people have commit rights to the repo. But anybody can suggest patches, bug fixes or even new features by sending pull requests that people with commit access can then apply. Typically, the owners of the repo will review the changes before merging them. Checking that they match the development guidelines for the project and that the license is valid and so on. Let's fix the typo in the file to see what the pull request looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we're done making changes to the file, we can make a change proposal, by scrolling down and filling in the description of the change. In this case, we fix the typo in the function documentation.\n",

On this screen, we can see a lot of information about our change. We can see what repositories and branches are involved in the creation of the pull request. We can also see that GitHub automatically created a branch called patch-1 for us. And that our change can automatically be merged, yay, no conflicts. This window also lets us review the change before we create an actual pull request. Once we're ready, we just click the Create pull request button.\n",

    "This opens a text box where we can enter comments about our change. In this case, a change is really simple, we just fixed the typo so there's nothing extra to add.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our last video, we saw how to create pull request directly on GitHub by using the web interface to edit files. This works for simple changes like fixing typos or adding documentation to a function, but it's not so great for making larger changes that we want to preview or test. To do that, we'll normally have a local copy of the repo in our computer and work with the forked repo as a remote. We'd need to use all the Git commands that we've learned up till now to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out this process by creating a fork of another repo. On top of the validations repo, our colleague blue-kale has created a rearrange repo, and we want to help them out. We'll go to the rearranged repo and create a fork by pressing the Fork button.\n",

    "It takes a few seconds to create a copy of the repo for our user. The copy will contain the current state of the repo including files and commit history. Once the fork is created, we're shown a page that corresponds to the same repo name, but it's under our user. \n",

Github allows projects to set their contribution guidelines. You'll find a link to them whenever you create a new pull request or issue in a project. So make sure you've read these guidelines and that your pull requests match them. In this video, we saw how to update our pull requests by doing new commits in our local Git repository and pushing them to the remote repository.
