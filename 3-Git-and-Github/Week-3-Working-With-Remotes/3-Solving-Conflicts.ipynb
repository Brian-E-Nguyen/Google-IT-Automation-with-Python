Now we know how to successfully complete a pull, merge, and push cycle, even when it means doing some manual merges. This was a complex exercise, and it's okay if some things still seem a bit scary. We all felt panic the first time we encountered a merge conflict. But don't worry, it gets easier with practice.

    "\n",
    "As we called up before, when using Git to work on a new feature or a big refactor of some kind, it's recommended best practice to create separate branches. There are many advantages to doing this. For example, it might take you a while to finish a new feature and in the meantime, there could be a critical bug that needs fixing in the main branch of the code. By having separate branches, you can fix the bug in the main branch, release a new version and then go back to working on your feature without having to integrate your code before it's ready. \n",

    "Another advantage of working in separate branches is that you could even release two or more versions out of the same tree. One being the stable version and the other being the beta version. That way, any disruptive changes can be tested on a few users or computers before they're fully released. So let's start a new branch to work on a small refactor of our code. Do you remember how to do that? You could create the branch first, and then check it out or we can just create it and check it out with git checkout-b and the new branch name.\n",
