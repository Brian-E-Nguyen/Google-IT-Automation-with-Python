    "## 1. Undoing Changes Before Committing\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to revert our changes is one of the most powerful features offered by version control systems. There's a bunch of different techniques available depending on which changes we need to undo. In this video and the next few coming up, we'll talk about the most common ways to revert changes in Git and when to use each approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Undoing Files Not In Staging Area\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might find yourself in a situation where you've made a bunch of changes to a file but decide that you don't want to keep them. You can change a file back to its earlier committed state by using the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the file you want to revert. Speaking of, let's try this out using our scripts repository. We'll edit our all checks pi script and remove the check reboot function, then save and go back to the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os, sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    if check_reboot():\n",
    "        print('Pending reboot')\n",
    "        sys.exit(1)\n",
    "    print('Everything ok')\n",
    "    sys.exit(0)\n",
    "main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool. We've made our change. Let's try our script and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python all_checks.py\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"all_checks.py\", line 9, in <module>\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "  File \"all_checks.py\", line 4, in main\n",
    "    if check_reboot():\n",
    "NameError: name 'check_reboot' is not defined\n",

    "$ git status\n",

    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/3-Git-and-Github' by 10 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes not staged for commit:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n",
    "  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By deleting that function, we've actually broke the script. Let's see what git status has to say about this. As expected, we see that our file is modified and the changes aren't staged yet. Check out how git gives us a couple helpful tips on what to do now. We can run git add to stage our changes or we can run git checkout to discard them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need help remembering what this command does, think of it this way, you're checking out the original file from the latest storage snapshot. Let's do that now. We'll check out at the original file and then take a look at what git status has to say about it and finally retry our script.\n",

    "\n",
    "Done and done. With that, we've demonstrated how we can use git checkout to revert changes to modify files before they get staged. This command will restore the file to the latest storage snapshot, which can be either committed or staged. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you've made additional changes to a file after you've staged it, you can restore the file to the earlier stage version. If you need to check out individual changes instead of the whole file, you can do that using the `-p` flag. This will ask you change by change if you want to go back to the previous snapshot or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Undoing Files Already in Staging Area\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for undoing unstaged changes. What if you added the changes to the staging area already? Don't stress. If we realize we've added something to the staging area that we didn't actually want to commit, we can unstage our changes by using the git reset command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Staging changes that we don't actually intend to commit happens all the time. Especially if we use a command like git add star, where the star is a file glob pattern used in Bash that expands to all files. This command will end up adding any change done in the working tree to the staging area. While sometimes that might be what we want, it can also lead to some surprises. Let's try it out with an example. First, we'll pretend we're trying to debug a problem in our script. For that, we create a temporary file with the output of our script. Then, we'll add all unstaged changes in our working tree using git add star. Finally, check the status using git status. We can see that this output file, which was supposed to be a temporary file for debugging, has now been staged in our repo but we didn't want to commit it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python all_checks.py > output.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "$ cat output.txt\n",

    "        new file:   output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently, the git status command tells us how to unstage the file right there in the output. The example output mentions the head alias. Remember what that means? That's right. It's the current checked out snapshot. So by running the suggested command, we're resetting our changes to whatever's in the current snapshot. Let's try it out.\n",

This can lead to some confusing situations when working with other people and should definitely be avoided. So remember, fixing up a local commit with amend is great and you can push it to a shared repository after you fixed it. **But you should avoid amending commits that have already been made public.** If this sounds confusing now, don't worry. We'll mention it again when we talk about collaborating with others through shared repositories. \n",

    "Fixing your work before you commit is good. But what happens if it's already been snapshotted by Git? Let's say you host to Git repository on a company server that contains all kinds of useful automation scripts that you and your coworkers use. One morning before coffee, you make a few changes to one of these scripts and commit the updated files. A few hours later, you start to receive tickets from users indicating some part of the script is broken. From the errors they describe, it sounds like the problem is related to your recent changes.

    "So once we issue that git revert command, we're presented with the text editor commit interface that we've all seen before.

The first-line mentions that it's reverting the commit we just did called Add call to disk full function. The extra description even includes the identifier of the commit that got reverted. While we could use this description as is, it's usually a good idea to add an explanation of why we're doing the rollback. Remember that the goal of these descriptions is to help our future selves understand why things happen. In this case, we'll explain that the reason for the rollback is that the code was calling a function that wasn't defined.\n",

    "Once we're done entering the description, we can exit and save as usual. You'll notice the output that we get from the git revert command looks like the output of the git commit command. This is because git revert creates a commit for us. Since a revert is a normal commit, we can see both the commit and the reverted commit in the log. Let's look at the last two entries in the log using dash P and dash two as parameters. As demonstrated before, the dash P parameter lets us see the patch created by the commit while the dash two perimeter limits the output to the last two entries. \n",

We can see that the original commit shows the lines we added by preceding them with a plus sign. The same line shows up with a minus sign in the newer commit message indicating that they were removed. Just like that, the bad commit is reverted and the error stopped. In this example, we reverted the latest commit in our tree. But what if we had to revert a commit that was done before that?

    "Essentially, what this algorithm does is take a bunch of data as input and produce a 40 character string from the data as the output. In the case of Git, the input is all information related to the commit, and the 40 character string is the commit ID.\n",

    "### 4.1 Why Use SHA1 Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Still you might be wondering, why on earth would you use a long jumble of letters as an ID for commit, instead of incrementing an integer, like 123, etc? To answer that, let's take a quick look at the reason why Git uses a hash instead of a counter, and how that hash is computed. Although SHA1 is a part of the class of cryptographic hash functions, Git doesn't really use these hashes for security. Instead, they're used to guarantee the consistency of our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having consistent data means that we get exactly what we expect. To quote Git's creator, Linus Torvalds, you can verify the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. This is really useful in distributed systems like Git because everyone has their own repository and is transmitting their own pieces of data. Computing the hash keeps data consistent because it's calculated from all the information that makes up a commit. The commit message, date, author, and the snapshot taken of the working tree. The chance of two different commits producing the same hash, commonly referred to as a collision, is extremely small. So small, it wouldn't happen by chance. It'd take a lot of processing power to cause this to happen on purpose. If you use a hash to guarantee consistency, you can't change anything in the Git commit without the SHA1 hash changing too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our discussion about fixing commits with the dash dash amend command? Each time we amend a commit, the commit ID will change. This is why it's important not to use dash dash amend on commits that have been made public.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data integrity offered by the commit ID means that if a bad disk or network link corrupt some data in your repository, or worse, if someone intentionally corrupt some data, Git can use the hash to spot that corruption. Aha, it will say, the data you've got isn't the data you expected, something went wrong.\n",

    "Okay, now that we've seen how we can identify the commit that we want to revert, let's call the git revert command with this identifier. As usual, this will open an editor where we should add a reason for the rollback. In this case, we'll say that the previous name was actually better. Hooray for flip-flopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we called out before, when we generate the rollback, Git automatically includes the ID of the commit that we're reverting. This is useful when looking at a repo with a complicated history that includes a lot of commits. Now, once we save and exit the commit message, Git will actually perform the rollback and generate a new commit with its own ID. See how before the name of our commit the revert command already shows the first eight characters of the commit ID? Let's use git show to look at it.\n",

    "All right, we've managed to revert a commit that wasn't the most recent one. Well done, time travelers. Over the past several videos we've covered a bunch of ways to undo things in Git. Whether for unstaged changes, staged changes, amending commits, or rolling back changes. If anything still seems unclear, now's a great time to practice these commands on your local computer, try things out, and come up with more examples of use cases you want to test. Up next, we've spun up a handy cheat sheet summarizing all the content we just covered. When you're ready, move on to the next quiz and put all this new knowledge into practice. We've been learning a lot of complex things over the past few videos, so once you're done with that quiz you should reward yourself for getting through this technical detail with a break. You earned it. Grab a coffee, tea, or snack and let the concepts settle for a bit. I'll meet you over the next video."
